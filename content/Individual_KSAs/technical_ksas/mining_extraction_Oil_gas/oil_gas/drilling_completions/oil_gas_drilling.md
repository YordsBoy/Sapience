proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness  
    indicator: Knows basic terminology (rig, well, reservoir) and the purpose of drilling equipment; aware of safety hazards (blowouts, gas leaks).
  - level: Basic  
    indicator: Supports drill rig setup and teardown; operates simple controls or handles drill pipe under direction; follows safety procedures and checks gauges during drilling.
  - level: Intermediate  
    indicator: Runs a drilling operation on shift; adjusts drilling mud, weight on bit, and rotation speed based on rock feedback; interprets instrument readings; assists in minor well control procedures.
  - level: Advanced  
    indicator: Supervises drilling crews and plans daily drilling activities; optimizes drilling techniques to improve rate of penetration and prevent problems; coordinates with engineers on well design and implements pressure control protocols.
  - level: Expert  
    indicator: Oversees multiple drilling projects or an entire rig; designs drilling programs (directional drilling plans, casing programs) to maximize safe extraction; ensures compliance with industry standards (API) and environmental regulations; mentors drilling engineers and crew leaders.

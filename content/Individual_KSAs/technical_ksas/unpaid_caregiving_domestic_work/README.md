Unpaid Caregiving & Domestic Work
=================================

Family caregivers provide **unpaid support for 53 million people** in the U.S. alone. To stay safe, effective, and healthy, they now must master infection-prevention (CDC Core IPC), safe mobility techniques (OSHA Safe-Patient Handling), and technology tools ranging from assistive devices to remote-patient monitoring that improves caregiver outcomes. Dementia communication requires Alzheimer’s Association strategies and validation therapy, while respite has proven mental-health benefits. Nutrition planning leverages USDA MyPlate for older adults, and digital budgeting apps identified by AARP help manage shared finances safely. The 12 KSAs below integrate these best practices and close gaps on home infection control and safe transfers.

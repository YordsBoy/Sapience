# 📚 Sapience Git + Local Management Manual

*(Full Master Version for Word, Docs, or Repo Use)*

---

## 🛠 Purpose
This manual explains how to manage the Sapience repository, clone it, update it, and operate Git workflows like a professional system-builder.
---
## 💻 About Your Environment

Sapience supports development in both:
- **Local Machines** (Windows/Mac/Linux)
- **GitHub Codespaces** (Cloud-hosted VSCode)

If using Codespaces:
- Your development happens remotely
- Always remember to `git commit` and `git push` to sync back to GitHub
- Otherwise, workflow is identical

```
- Use pull requests if collaborating.

# 📜 .gitignore Template (Recommended)

Add a `.gitignore` file at your project root with:

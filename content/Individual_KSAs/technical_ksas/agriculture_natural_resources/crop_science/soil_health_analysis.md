description: >
  Assesses physical, chemical, and biological soil properties—pH, nutrient
  levels, organic matter, microbiome diversity—to guide fertilisation, crop
  rotation, and regenerative practices.
source_frameworks:
  - "Adapted from O*NET Soil and Plant Scientist tasks (USDOL/ETA, CC BY 4.0)"
proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness
    indicator: Collects soil samples following basic instructions.
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Interprets lab reports for pH and N-P-K; recommends standard amendments (intro to soil-fertility management).
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Conducts field surveys; uses portable sensors and GIS layers to build variable-rate nutrient maps; cross-references **`climate_resilient_farming`** for integrated fertility & carbon strategies.
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Incorporates biological indicators (microbial activity, earthworm counts) into fertility plans; advises on cover-cropping and compost integration.
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Designs region-wide soil-health improvement programs; mentors agronomists; publishes best-practice guidelines on regenerative soil management.

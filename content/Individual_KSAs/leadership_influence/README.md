# Leadership & Influence (Cross-Sector)

**Sector Overview:** This sector covers the competencies needed to lead people and influence outcomes in any organization. These cross-sector leadership KSAs include setting vision, driving change, guiding teams, communicating strategically, and upholding ethics. They equip individuals to inspire others, navigate crises, and build a positive organizational culture. All leadership KSAs are marked `perennial` because effective leadership principles remain relevant over time, even as contexts change. By mastering these, individuals can lead with integrity and influence in diverse environments.

- **Prosci AI-Driven Change-Management Guidance (2025)** — stakeholder sentiment and predictive analytics use-cases
- **MIT Sloan Management Review (Apr 2025) “How to Make Data Work Meaningful”** — linking data tasks to engagement & sentiment telemetry.
- **ResearchGate “Change-Management Trends in the AI Modern World” (2024) —** AI sentiment-analysis impact on change outcomes.

- **Microsoft Viva Glint (2025) Product Docs** — real-time engagement dashboards and privacy controls (not shown in search results but publicly available).  
- **Gartner “HR Analytics Tools 2025”** — covers sentiment-tracking modules for change readiness.
- **U.S. OPM Leadership Competencies:** Many KSAs align with OPM’s Executive Core Qualifications (ECQs). For example, *Influencing/Negotiating* (ECQ 5) informed the *Persuasion & Negotiation* KSA, and *Developing Others* (ECQ 2) informed *Delegation & Empowerment*. OPM’s definitions are public domain and were used to ensure completeness of concepts.
- **NICE Framework (Leadership)** – Certain leadership behaviors (especially in cybersecurity leadership roles) align with NICE Workforce Framework leadership competencies. Where applicable (e.g., communication and strategic thinking in a cyber context), NICE guideline language was considered (public domain).
- **World Economic Forum – Future of Jobs 2025:** Highlighted “Leadership and social influence” as a top skill. Our addition of Persuasion/Negotiation addresses this insight (no WEF text used, just its identification of the skill gap).
- **Academic & Business Sources:** General leadership literature supports these KSAs. For instance, the importance of empowering leadership is well-documented in management research (e.g., Harvard Business Review articles on delegation – not directly cited in YAML due to copyright, but conceptually integrated). We focused on public domain sources for actual wording.

description: >
  Implements surface-code and bosonic-code error-correction schemes; evaluates logical-qubit overhead, syndrome extraction circuits, and fault-tolerance thresholds on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices.
source_frameworks:
  - "EU Quantum Technologies Competence Framework – fault-tolerant QC profile"
proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness
    indicator: States why qubit decoherence demands error correction; sketches Shor code concept.
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Simulates small surface-code patches in Qiskit Ignis; measures logical error rate.
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Designs syndrome-measurement circuits; benchmarks threshold under realistic noise models.
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Integrates real-time decoding hardware; optimizes lattice surgery for qubit overhead.
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Contributes to open-source QEC compilers; publishes new code families and threshold analyses.

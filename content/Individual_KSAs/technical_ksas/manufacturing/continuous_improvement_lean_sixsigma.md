  - "Quality"
description: "Applies continuous improvement methodologies (Lean manufacturing principles and Six Sigma techniques) to eliminate waste, improve process efficiency, and reduce defects in production processes."
source_frameworks:
  - "Informed by ASQ Lean Six Sigma Body of Knowledge (conceptual) and public domain Lean guides:contentReference[oaicite:226]{index=226}:contentReference[oaicite:227]{index=227}"
proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness
    indicator: Aware of basic Lean concepts (e.g. the 8 wastes) and the idea of reducing waste and variability.
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Participates in a Kaizen event or process mapping; uses simple 5S techniques to organize a workspace; follows a standard operating procedure and notices obvious wasteful steps.
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Uses Lean tools like Value Stream Mapping and root cause analysis (5 Whys) to identify inefficiencies; applies Six Sigma basics (e.g. calculates a process defect rate); contributes to improvement projects that streamline workflow or reduce scrap.
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Leads continuous improvement teams; implements Lean initiatives such as pull systems/Kanban, SMED (quick changeovers), or visual management; utilizes Six Sigmaâ€™s DMAIC approach with data analysis to reduce variation and achieve measurable quality gains (e.g. hits a Six Sigma level for critical processes).
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Champions a culture of continuous improvement across the organization; integrates Lean Six Sigma into strategic objectives; mentors others (Black Belt level expertise) in methodology; achieves significant cost and quality improvements that transform processes and are benchmarked by industry peers.

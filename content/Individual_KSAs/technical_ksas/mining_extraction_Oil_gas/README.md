# Mining & Extraction

**Sector Overview:** This sector covers the competencies needed in mining industries – from exploration of minerals to extraction, and eventually site closure. Modern mining demands expertise in not only getting resources out of the ground (with advanced equipment and techniques) but also ensuring safety and environmental stewardship. Key focus areas include efficient extraction methods (often differentiated by surface vs. underground mining), rigorous safety and health practices, and responsible management of environmental impacts (reclamation of land and waste management). Trends like automation of mining equipment and improved safety analytics are shaping the field.

## Sub-domains

- **Exploration & Geology:** Finding and evaluating mineral deposits. *(e.g. Geological Surveying & Exploration; Resource Modeling)*
- **Extraction Techniques:** Methods of extracting resources. *(e.g. Surface Mining Operations; Underground Mining Methods – drilling, blasting)* 
- **Equipment Operation & Maintenance:** Operating heavy machinery and mine systems. *(e.g. Heavy Equipment Operation; Mine Ventilation Systems)*
- **Safety & Compliance:** Ensuring worker safety and regulatory compliance. *(e.g. Mine Safety Protocols; Hazard Management (PPE, HSE standards))* 
- **Environmental Management & Closure:** Rehabilitating sites and managing environmental impact. *(e.g. Mine Site Rehabilitation & Closure; Tailings Waste Management)*

**Horizon Key:** Almost all competencies here are `core_2025` – current standard practices. Some high-tech aspects (like fully autonomous mining operations) might be considered `emerging`, but core safety and extraction skills remain central.

## Referenced Frameworks & Standards

- **O*NET OnLine:** O*NET profiles for *Mining Engineers*, *Geological Engineers*, and *Mine Shuttle Car Operators*, etc., provided baseline competency descriptions. For example, geological surveying tasks were aligned with O*NET’s content on geoscience and exploration (public domain). We credit O*NET where their descriptions shaped our KSAs (CC BY 4.0 usage).
- **MSHA (Mine Safety & Health Administration):** U.S. MSHA regulations and training materials (public domain) guided all safety-related KSAs. Our *Mine Safety Protocols* and *Site Rehabilitation* KSAs incorporate MSHA’s standards for workplace safety and mine closure:contentReference[oaicite:127]{index=127}. These ensure content reflects real regulatory requirements.
- **ISO & Industry Standards:** International standards like ISO 45001 (Occupational Health & Safety) and ISO 14001 (Environmental Management) for mining were used as reference points for best practices in safety and environmental management. (No text copied, but principles included.)
- **Environmental Regulations:** We consulted public guidelines from environmental agencies (e.g., the U.S. EPA’s guidelines on mine reclamation and water quality) for the Mine Site Rehabilitation KSA. These public domain sources ensure our content meets or exceeds typical regulatory expectations.
- **Academic & Industry Training:** Concepts from free university lectures on mining engineering (e.g., basics of blasting, mine planning) and open-pit design textbooks (where permissible) were used to double-check the technical accuracy of our KSAs (conceptual verification only).
- **API 653 – Tank Inspection, Repair & Reconstruction:** Provides minimum fitness-for-service criteria used in the API Tank & Pipeline Inspection Compliance KSA. 
- **ISO 16530-1 – Well-Integrity Life-Cycle Governance:** Grounds the Well-Integrity Life-Cycle Assurance KSA, detailing barrier management from design through abandonment. 
- **SIGTTO LNG Cargo-Handling Competency Standards:** Supply operational and safety benchmarks for the LNG Terminal Cargo-Handling Operations KSA.

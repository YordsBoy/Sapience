proficiency_levels:  
  - level: Awareness  
    indicator: Aware of common smart building features (smart locks, connected sensors) and their basic purpose.  
  - level: Basic  
    indicator: Assists in using a property management app or dashboard (e.g., checking sensor readings, adjusting settings per instructions); can explain features of a smart home/building to tenants (like how to use a smart thermostat).  
  - level: Intermediate  
    indicator: Configures and maintains building IoT systems (sets schedules for smart HVAC, monitors security camera feeds remotely); uses data from PropTech platforms to identify issues (unusually high energy use, etc.) and suggests improvements.  
  - level: Advanced  
    indicator: Integrates multiple smart systems into a unified platform; optimizes building operations through tech (e.g., automates energy savings measures); liaises with PropTech vendors to implement upgrades and ensures building meets WiredScore or similar smart building standards.  
  - level: Expert  
    indicator: Oversees smart technology deployment across a portfolio of properties; makes strategic decisions on PropTech investments; contributes to industry discussions on smart building best practices or standards; leverages data to significantly enhance asset value and tenant experience.

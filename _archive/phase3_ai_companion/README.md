# Phase 3 Archive — AI Companion System

**Status:** DEFERRED  
**Target Phase:** Phase 3 (2028+)  
**Archived:** February 2026

## Overview

This directory contains the original AI companion design for Sapience — a sophisticated system for AI-guided self-reflection, emotional intelligence, and ongoing personal development support.

**This content is preserved for future development but is not a current priority.**

Sapience has evolved into an L&D company delivering human-led coaching, training, and consulting services. The AI companion features represent the long-term vision (Phase 3) that will be built upon the foundation established in Phase 1 (human-delivered services) and Phase 2 (technology-augmented delivery).

## Key Concepts in This Archive

### Memory System
- Dynamic memory objects tagged by category, theme, emotional tone, confidence weight
- Update vs. echo logic for evolving beliefs
- Mirror summary refreshes every 2-4 weeks
- Private layering for sensitive content
- User-driven memory shaping

### Cadence Modes
- Daily Pulse, Weekly Compass, Milestone Mode, On-Demand
- Nudge intelligence based on pattern detection
- Priority-aware and consent-driven prompts

### Modular Use Modes
- Coach Mode, Confidant Mode, Quiet Companion Mode
- Journal Mode, Socratic Mode
- Dynamic switching based on user state

### Trust Repair
- Rupture detection and acknowledgment
- Tone calibration and repair prompts
- Long-term repair logic with gentle presence mode

## Why This Was Deferred

### Strategic Sequencing

The original vision was ambitious: an AI companion that could provide ongoing, emotionally intelligent support for personal development. However, building this as the *first* product carried risks:

1. **Credibility gap** — Launching AI-first without proven methodology
2. **Market readiness** — Augusta market values human connection
3. **Sustainability** — SaaS subscriptions require scale; services generate revenue immediately
4. **Methodology refinement** — Human delivery allows iteration before automation

### The Phased Approach

```
Phase 1 (Current): Human-Delivered Services
├── Establish credibility through coaching outcomes
├── Refine methodology through direct client work
├── Build competency database (UPLS + technical KSAs)
└── Generate revenue to sustain operations

Phase 2 (Planned): Technology-Augmented Delivery
├── Digital intake and assessment tools
├── Client portal and progress tracking
├── Online learning platform
└── Coach/facilitator dashboards

Phase 3 (Future): AI-Native Platform ← THIS ARCHIVE
├── AI companion for continuous support
├── Dynamic memory and personalization
├── Hybrid human-AI delivery model
└── Scaled access with tiered human involvement
```

## Reactivation Criteria

This archive should be reactivated when:

- [ ] Phase 1 success metrics achieved (50+ clients, sustainable revenue)
- [ ] Phase 2 tools deployed and adopted
- [ ] Client data and patterns accumulated for AI training
- [ ] Market demand for AI-augmented coaching validated
- [ ] Technical infrastructure ready for AI integration

---

## Integration Notes for Future Development

When Phase 3 begins, these designs should be:

1. **Reviewed against UPLS framework** — The intake flow should map to competency assessment
2. **Integrated with client data** — Memory system should leverage Phase 2 progress tracking
3. **Aligned with coach workflows** — AI should augment, not bypass, human coaches
4. **Updated for AI advances** — LLM capabilities will have evolved significantly

### Competency Integration Points

| Archive Concept | UPLS Connection |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Tone calibration | Effective Communication, Emotional Intelligence |
| Belief reframing | Growth Mindset, Self-Reflective Insight |
| Value alignment | Integrity Alignment, Purpose Articulation |
| Saboteur work | Impulse Control, Metacognition |
| Resilience anchoring | Resilience, Stress Management |

## Do Not

- ❌ Actively develop these features
- ❌ Include in current sprint planning
- ❌ Reference as "coming soon" in marketing
- ❌ Delete or significantly modify (preserve the vision)

## Do

- ✅ Preserve for future reference
- ✅ Review periodically for relevance
- ✅ Note insights from Phase 1-2 that inform future design
- ✅ Update this README if strategic direction changes

## Original Vision Statement

From the founding conversations:

> *"A translation system between human pain, hope, and trajectory—and an intelligence that can help carry the weight."*

> *"How do I make this power legible, safe, and useful for the people in my community who never got taught how to dream in code?"*

This vision remains core to Sapience's mission. The phased approach ensures we build it on a sustainable foundation.

description: >  
  Masters modern gene-editing tools and protocols such as CRISPR-Cas9, TALENs, and base editors; designs and executes gene edits in cell lines or model organisms, and applies proper validation and bioethics review for genetic modifications.  
source_frameworks:  
  - "NIH Gene Therapy Laboratory Guidelines (2025)"  
  - "ISO 20387 Biotechnology–Biobanking Requirements"  
proficiency_levels:  
  - level: Awareness  
    indicator: Explains the basic concept of CRISPR and gene editing; can perform simple genetic transformations with guidance.  
  - level: Basic  
    indicator: Executes a standard CRISPR-Cas9 protocol in vitro; prepares reagents and uses kits to knock out a gene in a cell culture.  
  - level: Intermediate  
    indicator: Designs custom gRNAs for targeted gene edits; manages on/off-target analyses; implements gene editing in model organisms (e.g. mice) following safety protocols.  
  - level: Advanced  
    indicator: Optimises gene editing efficiency, troubleshoots complex editing projects (multiplexed edits); integrates automation (robotic pipetting) for high-throughput genome engineering.  
  - level: Expert  
    indicator: Leads development of novel gene editing approaches or therapeutics; establishes lab-wide gene editing standards; navigates regulatory approvals for gene-edited products.

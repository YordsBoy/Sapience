description: >
  Conducts ASHRAE Level 1-3 audits; benchmarks facilities, identifies ECMs (energy-conservation measures), calculates ROI, and verifies M&V results.
source_frameworks:
  - "ASHRAE Standard 211-2018"
proficiency_levels:  
  - level: Awareness  
    indicator: Identifies obvious energy wastes (e.g. lights left on, poor insulation) and suggests basic remedies; familiar with the concept of an energy audit; reads utility bills and basic ENERGY STAR scores.  
  - level: Basic  
    indicator: Performs walk-through audit; uses simple tools (e.g. energy meters or IR thermometers) to measure usage; documents findings; ; lists low-cost ECMs and recommends straightforward fixes.  
  - level: Intermediate  
    indicator: Conducts detailed energy audits of facilities, analyzing HVAC, electrical, and building envelope performance; uses data-loggers and BMS exports; calculates ROI for efficiency upgrades such as equipment retrofits or improved controls.  
  - level: Advanced  
    indicator: Implements comprehensive energy optimization projects (advanced HVAC control systems, variable frequency drives, etc.); monitors energy metrics over time to validate savings and adjust strategies; oversees retro-commissioning.  
  - level: Expert  
    indicator: Develops organization-wide energy management policies and programs; integrates IoT sensors and automation for real-time energy optimization; guides large-scale sustainability initiatives and certifications (e.g. LEED, Energy Star).

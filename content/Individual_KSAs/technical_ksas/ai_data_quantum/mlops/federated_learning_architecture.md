description: Designing, deploying, and optimizing Federated Learning (FL) systems that train shared models across decentralized data silos while preserving privacy and minimising communication overhead.
source_frameworks:
  - "arXiv 2502.05273 (2025)"
  - "Federated Learning Architecture Survey"
proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness
    indicator: Describes FL versus centralised Machine Learning (ML); sets basic hyper‑parameters in an open‑source FL framework.
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Configures client‑server orchestration and secure aggregation; monitors training rounds.
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Tunes communication/computation trade‑offs; mitigates straggler effects; implements Differential Privacy (DP) noise or secure enclaves.
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Designs hierarchical or peer‑to‑peer FL topologies; integrates heterogeneous edge devices and dynamic client selection.
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Architects multi‑tier FL across telecommunications networks, public cloud, and on‑device nodes; publishes benchmarks and privacy/security research.

  Applies Ellen MacArthur Foundation circular-design principles—modularity, repairability, recycling loops—to minimise waste and maximise material yields.
source_frameworks:
  - "Ellen MacArthur Foundation Circular Design Guide"
  - "ISO 20887 Design for Disassembly"
proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness
    indicator: Lists circular-design strategies; records off-cut waste.
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Nests parts for laser-cutting; labels materials for recycling.
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Designs snap-fit joints; enables part separation; tracks yield %.
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Uses generative nesting; reprocesses scrap into new feedstock; cuts waste by 30 %.
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Publishes design libraries; mentors community; secures circular-economy grants.

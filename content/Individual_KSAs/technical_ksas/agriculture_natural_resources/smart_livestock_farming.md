  - "Adapted from public-domain sources (USDA smart farming initiatives, O*NET Farm Manager competencies):contentReference[oaicite:94]{index=94}"
proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness
    indicator: Is aware of basic livestock health metrics (weight, feed intake) and common technologies like RFID tagging for animals.
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Uses simple monitoring devices (e.g. wearable animal sensors, automatic waterers) to track herd health and reports obvious issues.
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Implements IoT-based monitoring (e.g. sensors for temperature, heart rate); analyzes data trends (e.g. growth rates, milk yield) to adjust feed and care; familiar with automated feeding or milking systems.
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Manages an integrated smart barn system (climate control, health alerts, automated equipment); ensures data-driven decisions improve herd welfare and farm productivity.
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Designs and oversees large-scale precision livestock systems (e.g. networked sensors across multiple facilities); pioneers new tech adoption (like computer vision for animal behavior); mentors other farmers in data-driven livestock management.

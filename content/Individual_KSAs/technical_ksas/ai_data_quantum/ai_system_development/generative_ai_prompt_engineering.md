description: >
  Crafts, refines, and evaluates prompts that steer large-language or multimodal models toward accurate, safe, and high-utility outputs; applies techniques such as role-setting, chain-of-thought, system-/user-message separation, and few-shot prompting while mitigating risks like prompt injection.
source_frameworks:
  - "OpenAI Prompt Engineering Guide (2023)"
  - "Anthropic Claude 4 Prompt Best-Practices (2024)"
  - "NIST Generative-AI RMF Profile (2024)"
proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness
    indicator: Explains what a prompt is and recognises basic pitfalls (vagueness, broad scope).
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Uses documented patterns (role + task + context) to achieve consistent answers in a
      sandbox; tests prompts for edge-case failures.
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Applies chain-of-thought or few-shot examples to boost reasoning; measures output
      quality with rubrics; mitigates simple injection attempts via delimiters/validation.
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Optimises prompts for latency/cost trade-offs; A/B tests variants; parameterises
      templates for localisation or personalisation; collaborates with red-team to harden prompts.
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Designs enterprise prompt-libraries and governance; drives prompt-style innovation
      (hybrid prompting, self-consistency); mentors teams and aligns prompts with responsible-AI
      policies.

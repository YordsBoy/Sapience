Gig & Platform Economy
======================

Freelance and on-demand platforms generated an estimated **$455 B** worldwide in 2025, yet workers face algorithmic opacity, safety risks, and fragmented compliance duties. Studies link algorithmic management to reduced autonomy and well-being, while Human Rights Watch flags deactivation without recourse as a top concern. TransUnion’s 2025 survey shows 54 % of gig workers would switch apps over fraud or safety incidents. Diversifying across multiple apps boosts earnings but also raises cognitive load and hidden costs. Tax authorities are tightening reporting rules—IRS gig guidance and OECD DAC7—forcing independent workers to upskill in finance compliance.  

This sector’s **11 KSAs** empower platform workers to master reputation, compliance, algorithmic literacy, multi-app strategy, and growth marketing while safeguarding safety and earnings.

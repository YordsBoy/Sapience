Media Arts & Entertainment
=========================

From real-time LED-volume shooting to AI-driven localisation, screen content pipelines are transforming at pace. SMPTE ST 2110 IP-video and ST 2098 immersive-audio suites underpin modern production and spatial sound, while Dolby Atmos technical guidelines set room-build standards for next-gen mixes. Netflix’s Production Media Management shows cloud-first post workflows, and Adobe Team Projects plus Frame.io enable secure remote editing. Unity’s Animation Rigging and Unreal Engine’s virtual-production guides shorten iteration cycles. WIPO’s creator-rights initiatives and IAB/IETF streaming specs govern monetisation and distribution. These **18 KSAs** integrate such frameworks so creatives can ideate, produce, finish, and monetise content across platforms.

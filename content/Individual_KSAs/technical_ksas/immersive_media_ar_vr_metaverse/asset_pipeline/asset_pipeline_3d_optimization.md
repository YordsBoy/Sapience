proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness
    indicator: Lists target poly and texture budgets for mobile VR; imports ready-made models; applies basic decimation.
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Reduces polygon count; bakes normal maps and lightmaps; executes retopology, PBR texturing, and generates collision meshes.
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Automates LOD chains; profiles GPU memory ; balances draw-call budgets per headset targets.
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Builds procedural pipelines (Houdini, Blender Python) and GPU instancing schemes; implements streaming assets with Oodle/Krakatoa; tunes shader variants.
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Defines studio asset-quality standards; pioneers new compression workflows for emerging chipsets; sets PBR material standards for WebXR and native.

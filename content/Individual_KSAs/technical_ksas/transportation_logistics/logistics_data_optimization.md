description: >  
  Utilizes advanced software and data analytics to optimize transportation routes and supply chain efficiency;  
  interprets data from GPS tracking, telematics, and inventory systems to improve routing, reduce fuel consumption and delivery times, predict delays, and enhance overall supply chain visibility and responsiveness.

  - "CSCMP Supply Chain Analytics Standards"  
proficiency_levels:  
  - level: Awareness  
    indicator: Understands that logistics uses GPS and tracking; has seen a basic route map or schedule printout.  
  - level: Basic  
    indicator: Uses a routing software or GPS app to follow given routes; reports simple metrics (on-time deliveries, mileage) to supervisors; can interpret a basic dashboard (green/red indicators for delays).  
  - level: Intermediate  
    indicator: Adjusts routes based on real-time information (traffic, weather) using TMS (Transport Management System) tools; analyzes data from past deliveries (e.g., average delays on certain routes) to suggest schedule changes; monitors fuel or vehicle data to schedule maintenance or driver coaching.  
  - level: Advanced  
    indicator: Runs simulations or uses optimization algorithms to redesign delivery routes or distribution networks; incorporates multiple data sources (customer orders, warehouse inventory levels, driver hours) for integrated planning; improves KPIs (on-time rate, cost per mile) by making data-driven decisions; aligns practices with CSCMP guidelines.  
  - level: Expert  
    indicator: Oversees a logistics analytics team; implements AI/ML solutions for dynamic routing and demand forecasting; advises on supply chain strategy at an organizational level using data insights; contributes to industry best practices or standards for using big data in supply chain management, often via CSCMP or similar bodies.

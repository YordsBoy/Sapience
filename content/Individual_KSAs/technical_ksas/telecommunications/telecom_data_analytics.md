description: >  
  Utilizes data analytics and AI to monitor and optimize telecommunication network performance and customer experience;  
  analyzes large datasets from OSS/BSS, probes, and user devices to detect anomalies, predict outages or congestion, inform capacity planning, and personalize services (like dynamic quality adjustments or targeted network expansions).  
source_frameworks:  
  - "TM Forum Telecom Big Data Guidelines"  
proficiency_levels:  
  - level: Awareness  
    indicator: Aware that telecom companies collect a lot of network and usage data; has seen simple network statistics charts (e.g., traffic by hour).  
  - level: Basic  
    indicator: Runs predefined reports from OSS systems (like daily drop-call rate, data throughput); flags obvious outliers to senior engineers; uses basic tools or scripts to query logs for known issues.  
  - level: Intermediate  
    indicator: Works with network analytics platforms or big data tools to correlate metrics (e.g., linking cell congestion events with subscriber complaints); builds dashboards or uses ML-based systems that predict equipment faults or churn risk; contributes analysis insights during optimization meetings.  
  - level: Advanced  
    indicator: Develops and refines analytics models (with data scientist support) to proactively optimise the network (like an AI model to auto-tune parameters or suggest where to add capacity); uses TM Forum guidelines to govern data use and ensure interoperability; drives projects to improve KPI trends (latency, NPS scores) through data-driven actions.  
  - level: Expert  
    indicator: Leads a telecom analytics or SOC (service optimization center) team; sets strategy for AI adoption in network ops; works with cross-functional leaders to leverage data for business decisions (like new product planning based on usage trends); possibly contributes to industry standards or publications on telecom analytics best practices.

description: >  
  Works with autonomous and semi-autonomous transportation technologies in logistics operations;  
  monitors and dispatches autonomous delivery vehicles or drones, interacts with warehouse robots/AGVs, and implements protocols for safety and efficiency when humans and autonomous systems work in tandem in supply chain processes.  
source_frameworks:
  - "SAE J3016:2021"
  - "ISO 39001:2012"
  - "DOT Autonomous Vehicle Guidelines (2024)"  
proficiency_levels:  
  - level: Awareness  
    indicator: Has heard of self-driving trucks or delivery drones; knows they are being tested or used in some places; explains ADS levels; lists sensor suites.
  - level: Basic  
    indicator: Operates alongside basic warehouse automation (e.g., picks items that a robot brings); follows SOPs when an autonomous vehicle is moving in a facility (like yielding right of way); might use a simple interface to start/stop a delivery drone or robot under supervision; Configures geofence; performs safety driver protocol.
  - level: Intermediate  
    indicator: Supervises a fleet of autonomous delivery devices via software (can redirect a drone, or take control remotely if needed); performs routine checks and maintenance on autonomous equipment; coordinates routes between human drivers and autonomous ones to avoid conflicts; familiar with DOT guidelines on AV operations; tunes perception stack; validates ADS log; achieves disengage KPI  
  - level: Advanced  
    indicator: Implements new autonomous logistics programs (pilot testing delivery robots in a city or AI-driven trucking schedules); optimizes workflow to maximize autonomous usage safely; trains staff on interacting with and overseeing these systems; ensures compliance with regulations and internal safety for AVs/drones.  
  - level: Expert  
    indicator: Leads strategy for incorporating autonomy in a large logistics network; works with tech providers to refine autonomous system performance; certifies fleet pilot; contributes to policy development or industry standards for autonomous logistics (possibly via DOT advisory groups); quantifies ROI and improvements from autonomy to stakeholders.

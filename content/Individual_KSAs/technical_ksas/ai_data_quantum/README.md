# AI, Data & Quantum

## Sector Overview  
Artificial-intelligence adoption and data volumes continue to surge: the NIST AI Risk-Management Framework (RMF 1.0, 2023) now guides responsible AI practice across industries, while the OECD AI Principles (2019) remain the most widely adopted international ethics baseline. IDC forecasts the global datasphere will exceed **175 zettabytes by 2025**, demanding robust data-engineering pipelines and governance. On the frontier, venture funding in quantum technologies surpassed **$7 billion in 2025**, and vendor certifications such as IBM’s Quantum Developer Associate are maturing. Together, these forces make AI- and data-centric skills “core 2025,” while quantum-computing skills remain “watch 2030.”

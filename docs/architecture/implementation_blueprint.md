**1. UX INTERFACE DESIGN LOGIC**

**Intake Flow Recommendations:**

  - **Guided Onboarding (10–20 minutes)  
    Use progressive disclosure: show 1–2 questions per domain with
    opt-in “Go deeper” toggle**

  - **Dynamic Tone Selector  
    User chooses their preferred tone (“Direct,” “Gentle,” “Playful,”
    etc.) right away**

  - **Emotional Safety Opt-In  
    Let users set boundaries on sensitive areas (e.g., “don’t reflect on
    grief unless I initiate it”)**

**Ideal Formats:**

  - **Web or Mobile App UI**
    
      - **Vertical scrolling cards**
    
      - **Audio or text input modes**
    
      - **“Mood Tagging” slider**

  - **Voice Assistant (long-form)  
    Conversational intake with occasional summary recaps**

  - **Embedded Chatbot (short-form)  
    Daily/weekly check-ins that build context over time**

**🧠 2. MEMORY SYSTEM DESIGN**

**Memory Storage Best Practices:**

  - **Schema-based organization: Tag inputs by domain, emotional charge,
    time-sensitivity**

  - **Updateable nodes: Treat each memory as dynamic, evolving with
    user**

  - **Traceable summaries: Generate “mirror summaries” after each phase
    to validate AI understanding**

**🧩 3. DYNAMIC PROMPT ENGINEERING**

**Modular Response System:**

  - **Use contextual prompt blocks like:**
    
      - **\[Tone Selector\]: Mirror reflection in X style**
    
      - **\[User Boundary Flags\]: Avoid topics A, B unless Y condition
        is met**
    
      - **\[Cross-Category Linkage\]: Reference related insight from
        Energy + Career domains**

**Sample Output Logic:**

**“Based on your energy drain from meetings and your misalignment at
work, it sounds like you’re spending a lot of emotional currency on
roles that don’t reflect your deeper gifts. Want help exploring small
shifts or is this something you just want named for now?”**

horizon: emerging
cluster_tags:
  - "Neuro-Symbolic AI"
  - "Hybrid Reasoning"
description: >
  Designs end-to-end pipelines that combine sub-symbolic machine-learning (deep neural networks) with symbolic knowledge-representation and logical reasoning; implements frameworks such as DARPA ANSR and IBM Neuro-Symbolic
  AI to achieve interpretable, data-efficient, and verifiable models.
source_frameworks:
  - "DARPA ANSR (Assured Neuro-Symbolic Learning & Reasoning) program overview"
  - "IBM Research â€“ Neuro-Symbolic AI topic page (2025)"
  - "IBM/IEEE Workshop on Neuro-Symbolic Software Engineering 2025"
proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness
    indicator: Explains how symbolic rules augment neural nets; cites examples like neural theorem-proving.
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Integrates a pretrained vision model with a Prolog rule-set for simple scene-question answering; validates logic outputs.
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Builds hybrid pipelines with ontologies (OWL/RDF) and deep embeddings; debugs symbol grounding errors; measures accuracy vs. logic coverage.
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Implements neuro-symbolic training loops that learn and revise rules from data; optimises reasoning latency in PyTorch-based graphs; documents assurance cases per DARPA ANSR guidelines.
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Publishes new neuro-symbolic architectures; leads enterprise adoption for safety-critical domains; influences standards for explainable hybrid AI systems.

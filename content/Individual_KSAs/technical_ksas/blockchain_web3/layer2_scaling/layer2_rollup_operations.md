horizon: emerging
cluster_tags:
  - "Layer2"
  - "Rollups"
description: Deploying, monitoring, and optimising layer‑2 rollup networks—optimistic or zk‑based—to increase throughput, reduce gas costs, and maintain security through fraud proofs or validity proofs.
source_frameworks: ["Ethereum Foundation Rollup Guidelines"]
proficiency_levels:
- level: Awareness
indicator: Explains difference between optimistic and zero‑knowledge (zk) rollups; identifies bridge contracts; describes rollup security assumptions and fee models.
- level: Basic
indicator: Operates a test-sequencer; submits state-roots to L1; configures rollup nodes; deposits assets via canonical bridges; tracks state‑root submissions.
- level: Intermediate
indicator: Tunes batch posting intervals; monitors proof submission latency; integrates rollup block‑explorer analytics; handles reorgs.
- level: Advanced
indicator: Implements prover optimisations; manages sequencer fail‑over; coordinates cross‑rollup interoperability.
- level: Expert
indicator: Designs next-gen rollup architectures (zkEVM, validium) and cross-rollup bridges; designs multi‑layer scalability roadmaps; publishes proofs‑of‑concept for recursive rollups; advises Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) editors on rollup standards.

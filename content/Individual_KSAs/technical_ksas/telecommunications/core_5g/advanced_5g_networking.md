description: >  
  Manages and configures advanced 5G network features such as network slicing and multi-access edge computing (MEC); allocates network slices for different use cases (enhanced mobile broadband, IoT, ultra-reliable low-latency) via 5G core, and deploys edge computing resources to optimize latency and bandwidth for critical applications.  
source_frameworks:
  - "3GPP TS 23.501 R17/18"
  - "3GPP TS 23.502 R17/18" 
  - "3GPP Release 16 Specifications"  
proficiency_levels:  
  - level: Awareness  
    indicator: Knows that 5G has new capabilities beyond 4G; has heard terms like “network slicing” or “edge computing” without deep understanding; states 5G-Advanced roadmap; lists RedCap KPIs.  
  - level: Basic  
    indicator: Monitors a 5G network management dashboard; recognizes different quality-of-service levels; supports testing of a single network slice as instructed; understands MEC conceptually (servers closer to users); configures network slice template; enables UPF UDR integration.  
  - level: Intermediate  
    indicator: Configures basic slice parameters for a particular enterprise customer or application; works with edge cloud servers (e.g., deploying a CDN or local data processing); troubleshoots slice performance issues under guidance of engineers; keeps up with 3GPP updates on 5G features; tunes QoS Flow; validates XR latency < 5 ms; supports dual-connectivity.  
  - level: Advanced  
    indicator: Plans and implements multiple network slices across the operator’s network, ensuring isolation and QoS; integrates MEC solutions for low-latency apps (like autonomous vehicle communication nodes); fine-tunes slice resource allocation based on usage patterns and SLAs; ensures compliance with 3GPP standards in these deployments; automates slice SLA assurance via NWDAF; delivers URLLC-SAF.  
  - level: Expert  
    indicator: Architects the carrier’s overall 5G slicing strategy; leads national 5G-A deployment; collaborates in international forums or standardization (feeding back on slicing/MEC improvements); develops innovative services leveraging slices and MEC for new revenue streams; mentors network engineers on mastering 5G advanced capabilities.

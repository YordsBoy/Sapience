Creative & Cultural Industries
==============================

UNESCO and UNCTAD estimate the creative economy generates **3.1 % of global GDP** and supports over 50 million jobs worldwide. Digital transformation, XR storytelling, and new IP-monetisation models are redefining how creators produce, distribute, and earn from cultural works. At the same time, global heritage charters and digitisation standards raise the bar for preservation and access.

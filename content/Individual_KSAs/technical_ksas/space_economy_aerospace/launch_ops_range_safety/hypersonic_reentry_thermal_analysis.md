description: |
  Models aero-thermal loads for blunt-body and lifting-body vehicles using CFD, TPS (Thermal-Protection System) material databases, and NASA CEA; validates versus flight or arc-jet data.
source_frameworks:
  - "NASA TPSX Database"
proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness
    indicator: States stagnation heat-flux scaling with velocity and density.
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Runs convective heat-flux in Sutton-Graves correlation; sizes basic TPS.
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Conducts CFD with finite-rate chemistry; evaluates ablation recession.
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Optimises reusable TPS (SLA-561V, PICA-X); correlates to arc-jet tests.
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Leads hypersonic-vehicle certification; authors aero-thermal design
      standards.

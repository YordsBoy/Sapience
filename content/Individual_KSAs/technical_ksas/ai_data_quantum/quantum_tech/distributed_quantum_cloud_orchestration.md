label: Distributed Quantum-Cloud Orchestration for Hybrid Workloads
category: Technical
sector: AI_Data_Quantum
horizon: watch_2030
cluster_tags:
  - "Quantum Cloud"
  - "Hybrid Orchestration"
description: >
  Develops schedulers and orchestration layers that partition and route hybrid quantum-classical jobs across heterogeneous quantum-processing units (QPUs) and high-performance-computing (HPC) clusters; manages latency, queueing, error budgets, and cost optimisation for multi-vendor quantum clouds.
source_frameworks:
  - "Qonductor â€“ Cloud orchestrator for hybrid quantum-classical apps (arXiv 2408.04312)"
  - "Qoro Quantum + CESGA distributed circuit-simulation pilot 2025"
  - "AWS Braket hybrid-job interface & BB84 QKD example (2025 blog)"
  - "Cisco cross-vendor quantum-cloud orchestration announcement 2025"
proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness
    indicator: Describes why hybrid workflows need orchestration (classical pre- and post-processing, quantum resource scarcity).
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Submits a hybrid variational-quantum-eigensolver (VQE) job via a managed service (e.g., Braket); monitors queue time and cost.
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Implements a workflow that splits circuits across simulators and real QPUs; applies simple scheduling policies (first-fit, cost-aware).
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Develops custom resource-estimation and circuit-bundling logic (Qonductor-style); integrates error-mitigation metrics into scheduling.
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Architects multi-tenant quantum clouds; publishes open-source orchestration APIs; drives standardisation of hybrid-job descriptors and quantum-resource SLAs.

description: >
  Plans, sets up, and executes on-site or factory-based concrete and composite 3-D-printing operations; calibrates mix design, printing parameters, quality  assurance, and code compliance for structural and non-structural elements.
source_frameworks:
  - "ISO/ASTM 52900:2021 – Additive-Manufacturing Terminology"
  - "ISO/ASTM 52930:2023 – Qualification of AM Processes for Construction"
  - "ANSI Blog on AM Standards (2023) – overview for civil applications"
proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness
    indicator: Lists major AM processes (extrusion, shotcrete) and material properties (slump flow, set time).
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Prepares printable concrete mix; performs nozzle calibration and prints test coupons; records layer height consistency.
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Generates G-code from BIM model; adjusts print speed, temperature, and admixtures; validates dimensional tolerance and surface finish.
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Conducts structural testing (compressive, flexural) on printed walls; implements QA/QC plan compliant with ISO/ASTM standards; coordinates with local building-code officials.
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Designs large-scale AM construction workflows (robotic arms or gantry systems); optimises supply-chain (onsite batching, curing); authors guidelines for permitting and safety of AM job sites.

# Sapience Assessment Framework Policy

**Version:** 1.0
**Effective Date:** February 2026
**Purpose:** Establishes standards for evaluating client-submitted artifacts (transcripts, certifications, etc.) to determine competency proficiency levels.

---

## 1. Overview

Sapience uses a multi-source assessment approach that triangulates:
- Client self-assessment
- Artifact evidence (resumes, transcripts, certifications, appraisals)
- Coach observation and interview

This policy defines the criteria for evaluating artifact evidence.

---

## 2. Grade Weighting (Transcripts)

| Grade | Weight | Interpretation | Max Proficiency Supported |
|-------|--------|----------------|---------------------------|
| A, A- | **Full** | Strong evidence of competency mastery | Expert |
| B+, B, B- | **Full** | Adequate evidence of competency | Advanced |
| C+, C | **Partial** | Exposure, not mastery | Basic |
| C-, D, D+, D- | **None** | Insufficient evidence | — |
| F | **None** | No evidence | — |
| P (Pass) | **Partial** | Treat as C equivalent unless institution specifies 70%+ | Basic |
| W (Withdrawn) | **None** | No evidence | — |
| I (Incomplete) | **None** | No evidence | — |

### Application Rules

1. **Partial weight** evidence supports only Awareness or Basic proficiency levels
2. **Full weight** evidence can support any proficiency level, depending on course rigor
3. Multiple courses in the same competency area can compound evidence
4. Course description or syllabus strengthens mapping confidence

---

## 3. Recency Weighting

| Time Since Completion | Weight | Interpretation |
|-----------------------|--------|----------------|
| 0-3 years | **Current** | Skills likely retained and practiced |
| 3-7 years | **Reduced** | May need refresher; evidence of past capacity |
| 7+ years | **Foundational** | Demonstrates learning ability; current competency uncertain |

### Exceptions

- **Actively maintained credentials** (PMP with PDUs, CPA with CPE, nursing license with CE) reset the recency clock to date of last renewal
- **Continuous practice** (e.g., using skills daily in current role) overrides recency weighting
- **Coach discretion** may adjust weighting based on client interview

---

## 4. Certification Status

| Status | Treatment | Evidence Value |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **Active** | Currently valid and maintained | Full evidence |
| **Expired but renewable** | Lapsed but can be reinstated (e.g., lapsed PMP) | Foundational; indicates past competency |
| **Expired, non-renewable** | One-time credential (e.g., course completion certificate) | Apply recency rules |
| **Revoked** | Credential withdrawn by issuing body | No evidence; may be negative signal |

### Certification Mapping Confidence

| Certification Type | Mapping Confidence |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| Industry-standard professional (PMP, CPA, PHR, CISSP) | High — well-defined competency scope |
| Vendor-specific (Microsoft, AWS, Salesforce) | High for technical; partial for soft skills |
| Academic certificates | Medium — depends on rigor and recency |
| Micro-credentials / badges | Low to Medium — verify issuing body standards |
| Self-reported / unverified | None until verified |

---

## 5. Course-to-Competency Mapping Guidelines

### Phase 1 (Manual Coach Review)

Coaches map courses to competencies based on:
1. Course title
2. Course description (if available)
3. Client's recollection of content
4. Institution type (vocational, academic, professional)

### Mapping Confidence Levels

| Confidence | Criteria |
|------------|----------|
| **High** | Course title explicitly matches competency (e.g., "Leadership Development" → Leadership KSAs) |
| **Medium** | Course content likely includes competency (e.g., "Organizational Behavior" → Collaboration) |
| **Low** | Tangential relationship (e.g., "Business Ethics" → Ethical Governance) |

### Documentation Requirement

All coach-determined mappings must include:
- Source artifact reference
- Confidence level
- Rationale (1-2 sentences)

---

## 6. Common Certification → KSA Mappings

| Certification | Primary KSA Mappings | Confidence |
|---------------|---------------------|------------|
| PMP (Project Management Professional) | delegation_empowerment, stakeholder_coalition_building, strategic_thinking | High |
| PHR/SPHR (HR Certification) | mentoring_coaching, inclusive_leadership, ethical_governance | High |
| SHRM-CP/SCP | mentoring_coaching, change_leadership, conflict_resolution | High |
| ICF Coaching Credential | mentoring_coaching, effective_communication, self_reflective_insight | High |
| Six Sigma Green/Black Belt | critical_thinking, attention_detail | High |
| AWS/Azure/GCP Certifications | digital_literacy (plus technical KSAs) | High for technical |
| CliftonStrengths Certified Coach | self_reflective_insight, mentoring_coaching | High |
| CompTIA Security+ / CISSP | (technical KSAs: public_safety_security, core_it_cloud) | High for technical |
| SHRM BASK (conceptual alignment only) | accountability, learning_agility | Medium |

---

## 7. Artifact Priority Order

When evidence conflicts, prioritize in this order:

1. **Performance appraisal** (third-party observation of actual behavior)
2. **Active certification** (validated current competency)
3. **Recent work samples / portfolio** (demonstrated application)
4. **Resume achievements** (claimed outcomes)
5. **Transcripts** (academic exposure)
6. **Self-assessment** (perception)

---

## 8. Coach Override Authority

Coaches may override any artifact-based assessment when:
- Interview evidence contradicts documentation
- Client demonstrates competency not reflected in artifacts
- Artifacts are incomplete or potentially inaccurate
- Context-specific factors apply (e.g., military experience not well-documented)

All overrides must be documented with rationale.

---

## 9. Military Transition Considerations

Veterans often have substantial competency that is poorly documented in traditional artifacts. Coaches should:
- Proactively explore military experience through structured interview
- Map military leadership roles to Leadership & Influence competencies
- Use DD-214, training records, and MOS/NEC descriptions as evidence
- Apply coach override authority liberally for veteran clients with demonstrated capability

---

## 10. Data Retention

| Artifact Type | Retention Period | Storage Location |
|---------------|------------------|------------------|
| Raw artifacts (PDFs, images) | Duration of client engagement + 2 years | Secure cloud storage (encrypted) |
| Extracted assessment data | Duration of engagement + 5 years | Client database |
| Coach notes | Duration of engagement + 3 years | Client file |

Clients may request deletion at any time per privacy policy.

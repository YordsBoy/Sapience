description: >
  Measures and reduces cloud carbon footprint through carbon-aware workload placement, right-sizing, renewable-energy alignment, and FinOps-driven efficiency metrics (gCO₂e per vCPU-hr / per API call).
source_frameworks:
  - "Green Software Foundation – Carbon-Awareness principles (2024)"
  - "Microsoft–UBS Carbon-Aware Computing white paper 2023"
  - "FinOps Foundation State of FinOps 2025 – green-ops metrics"
  - "EU Energy-Efficiency Directive 2023 data-centre reporting"
proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness
    indicator: Reads carbon dashboards; explains difference between embodied and operational emissions.
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Tags resources for carbon reporting; schedules batch jobs in low-carbon regions; rightsizes idle VMs.
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Implements carbon-aware autoscaler; optimises storage tiering vs. durability CO₂ impact; tracks gCO₂e/unit.
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Integrates carbon signals (grid-intensity API) into CI/CD; drives cost + CO₂ trade-off decisions in FinOps reviews.
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Sets enterprise carbon-budget policies; reports to ESG frameworks (GHGP, CDP); leads supplier engagement on renewable PPAs.

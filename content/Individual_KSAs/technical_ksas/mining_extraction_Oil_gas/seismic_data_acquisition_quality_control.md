description: Planning, acquiring, and quality‑controlling land and marine seismic surveys using Society of Exploration Geophysicists (SEG) field procedures, ensuring data meets signal‑to‑noise, fold, and azimuth coverage requirements for subsurface imaging.
source_frameworks: ["SEG Field QC Manual","SPE Petroleum Geophysics Competency Matrix"]
proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness
    indicator: Identifies seismic sources (vibroseis, airgun); explains basic shot‑receiver geometry; observes HSSE rules.
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Monitors field QC metrics (first‑break times, noise floors); validates equipment tests; logs production statistics.
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Designs survey parameters (bin size, fold); analyses near‑real‑time brute stacks; troubleshoots spread problems.
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Optimises acquisition for full‑waveform inversion; manages blended‑source operations; oversees data conditioning for processing.
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Leads mega‑crew or 4D seismic programmes; sets corporate seismic QC standards; publishes acquisition‑design research.

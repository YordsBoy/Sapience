Government & Public Administration
==================================

Digitalisation, poly-crisis resilience, and data-driven policymaking are redefining public administration.  
OECD’s 2022 *Recommendation on Public-Policy Evaluation* urges evidence and transparency across the policy cycle, while the *Recommendation on Open Government* embeds citizen co-creation and integrity principles.  ISO 22301 and FEMA’s NIMS guide business-continuity capacities in an era of climate-driven disruptions.  NIST’s 2023 *AI Risk Management Framework* sets the bar for trustworthy AI in public services.  World Bank’s 2023 Procurement Framework updates value-for-money and integrity safeguards.  Rising citizen expectations are captured in the U.S. Digital Services Playbook and Web Design System standards

description: >
  Designing and implementing measures—passivation, controlled re‑entry, active debris removal—to inimise orbital debris in line with ISO 24113, Inter‑Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC) FCC 5-year
  post-mission disposal guidelines; analyzes collision risk and implements passivation, de-orbit, or graveyard-orbit maneuvers.

proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness
    indicator: Explains Kessler Syndrome; lists mitigation options; checks post‑mission disposal (PMD) timelines; calculates 25-year LEO re-entry rule; identifies breakup causes.
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Calculates ΔV for de‑orbit burns; designs passivation procedures; Runs DRAMA/MASTER risk models; sizes de-orbit propellant; files debris‑mitigation plans.
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Performs conjunction assessments; simulates breakup models; designs drag-sail or propulsion EOL kits; files FCC debris plan; coordinates disposal maneuvers.
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Implements active‑debris‑removal concepts; deploys drag‑sail or propulsion kits; analyses long‑term orbital evolution; optimises constellation shell disposals; validates compliance via ESA MASTER.
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Leads international debris‑mitigation working groups; innovates ADR (active debris removal) tech; shapes ISO/IADC updates; publishes debris‑risk analyses.

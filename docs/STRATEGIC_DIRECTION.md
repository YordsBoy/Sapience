# Sapience Strategic Direction

**Architectural Context for Development**
**Last Updated:** February 2026
**Status:** Authoritative — This document governs all development priorities

---

## Executive Summary

Sapience has evolved from its original conception as an AI-powered self-reflection platform into a Learning & Development (L&D) company that delivers human-led coaching, workshops, and consulting services. The competency framework (UPLS + 400+ technical KSAs) remains the core intellectual property, but the delivery model has shifted from AI-first to human-first with technology augmentation.

This document clarifies what is active, what is deferred, and how the codebase should be understood.

## Codebase Inventory by Phase

### PHASE 1 — ACTIVE (Maintain & Develop)

These directories and files are the current operational core:

| Path | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `content/Individual_KSAs/` | 400+ competency definitions (UPLS + technical) | CORE ASSET — Active maintenance |
| `content/Individual_KSAs/general/` | 15 Universal Professional Competencies | CORE ASSET |
| `content/Individual_KSAs/leadership_influence/` | 15 Leadership Competencies | CORE ASSET |
| `content/Individual_KSAs/self_management_personal_mastery/` | 15+ Self-Mastery Competencies | CORE ASSET |

| `docs/` | Documentation (architecture, guides) | ACTIVE — Update for L&D focus |

### PHASE 3 — DEFERRED (Preserve, Do Not Develop)

These directories contain the original AI companion vision. They should be preserved for future use but are not current development priorities:

| Path | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `flows/intake/` | 7-day AI-guided onboarding journey | DEFERRED — Phase 3 |
| `flows/intake/day1_tone_safety.md` | Day 1: Tone calibration, emotional safety | DEFERRED |

| `flows/intake/day3_*.md` | Day 3: Belief exploration | DEFERRED |
| `flows/intake/day4_belief_value.md` | Day 4: Value integration | DEFERRED |
| `flows/intake/day5_*.md` | Day 5: Purpose articulation | DEFERRED |
| `flows/intake/day6_*.md` | Day 6: Shadow integration | DEFERRED |
| `flows/intake/day7_closure_future.md` | Day 7: Closure and signal transfer | DEFERRED |

| `docs/architecture/global_memory_map__0_architecture_spec.md` | AI memory system | DEFERRED |
| `docs/architecture/implementation_blueprint.md` | AI UX and memory design | DEFERRED |

### PHASE 2 — TO BE BUILT (Not Yet Present)

These capabilities need to be developed for the technology-augmented phase:

| Capability | Description | Priority |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| Digital Intake Forms | B2C and B2B intake as web forms | HIGH |
| Competency Self-Assessment | Users rate themselves on relevant KSAs | HIGH |
| Gap Analysis Visualizer | Shows competency gaps vs. goals | HIGH |
| Learning Path Generator | Recommends Sapience offerings based on gaps | MEDIUM |
| Client Portal | Progress tracking, resource access, scheduling | MEDIUM |
| Coach Dashboard | Client overview, session notes, competency tracking | MEDIUM |
| Assessment Engine | Formal pre/post assessments tied to programs | MEDIUM |
| Organizational Dashboard | B2B aggregate view of team competencies | LOW (Phase 2b) |

### REQUIRES REVIEW (May Need Redesign)

These components were built for the SaaS model and may need reconfiguration:

| Path | Original Purpose | Review Needed |
|------|-----------------|---------------|
| `components/UserTierContext.js` | SaaS tier gating (free/pro/team/enterprise) | Redesign for service model |
| `pages/_app.js` | App wrapper with tier provider | Review tier logic |
| `pages/test.js` | Tier testing page | May be obsolete |
| Stripe integration | Subscription billing | Reconfigure for invoicing |
| `README.md` | Describes "self-reflection platform" | REWRITE for L&D company |

## Development Principles for Current Phase

### DO:

- Maintain and expand KSA content
- Build tools that support human-delivered services
- Create documentation that codifies methodology
- Design with Phase 2 in mind (digital intake, assessments)
- Keep Phase 3 code preserved but clearly separated

### DO NOT:

- Invest development time in AI companion features
- Build SaaS subscription infrastructure
- Treat the 7-day intake flow as current priority
- Develop features that bypass human coaches

### ARCHITECTURE GUIDANCE:

- Competency data is the foundation — keep it clean and complete
- Any new features should support coaches/facilitators, not replace them
- Client-facing technology should enhance the human relationship
- Data collection should feed into human decision-making

└── [Phase 2 directories TBD]
```

### Archiving Phase 3 Content

The `flows/` directory should be moved to `_archive/phase3_ai_companion/` with a README explaining:

```markdown
# Phase 3 Archive — AI Companion System

This directory contains the original AI companion design for Sapience.
These features are DEFERRED until Phase 3 (2028+).

## Contents
- intake/ — 7-day AI-guided onboarding journey
- post_intake/ — Ongoing AI companion model

## Status
Preserved for future development. Do not actively develop.
The L&D company must be established (Phase 1) and technology-augmented
(Phase 2) before these features become priority.

## Reactivation
When Phase 3 begins, these designs will be reviewed and updated to
integrate with the competency framework and client data accumulated
in Phases 1-2.
```

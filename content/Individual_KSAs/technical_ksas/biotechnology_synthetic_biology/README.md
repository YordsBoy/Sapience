# Biotechnology & Synthetic Biology

## Sector Overview  
Synthetic-biology revenue is projected to reach **USD 18.9 billion by 2025** with a CAGR of 17 % through 2030, reflecting rapid commercialisation of engineered organisms and bio-based products.  Breakthroughs in CRISPR gene-editing continue, with more than 75 clinical trials underway as of mid-2025.  Automation is scaling R&D: biofoundry facilities integrate robotics, analytics, and data pipelines to accelerate design-build-test cycles.  Bio-risk governance advances alongside innovation—ISO 35001 sets global biorisk-management requirements, while WHO’s **Laboratory Biosafety Manual (4th Ed.)** standardises safe lab practice.  Quality and regulatory rigor remain critical: **ISO 13485** guides biologics quality-management, and updated FDA gene-therapy guidances clarify CMC expectations.  Collectively, these trends drive a skills mix of **core 2025** wet-lab and bio-data competencies, with automation, AI-driven design, and advanced biosecurity positioned as **emerging**.

**FAIL-SAFE FRAMEWORK: CORE SYSTEM FUNCTION**

A backend resilience architecture to prevent interaction collapse due to
silence, recursion, emotional load, or length-based context strain.

**🧠 FUNCTION: INTELLIGENT CONTEXT STABILIZER (ICS)**

**Purpose:** Prevent breakdowns in long, emotionally nuanced sessions by
anchoring pacing, memory, and reflection.

  - ⏳ **Silence Buffer Logic:**
    
      - \< 60s: Passive listening.
    
      - 60s–3m: Gentle optional prompt: “Still with me? No rush—just
        here.”
    
      - 3m: Assume pause or disengagement. System logs memory node +
        offers re-entry anchor upon return.

  - 🔁 **Recursion Guard:**
    
      - If 2+ repeated queries about prior AI phrasing or metaphor
        detected, reroute to grounding reflection:

“Seems like that stirred something. Want to explore how it landed?”

  - 🪜 **Checkpoint Architecture:**
    
      - Divide session into emotional chapters:
        
          - Tone + Calibration
        
          - Purpose + Entry
        
          - First Insight
        
          - Expansion
        
          - Integration/Close
    
      - Save soft memory nodes after each.
    
      - Upon session break: return user to **last named anchor**, not
        generic restart.

  - 🪞 **Silence-Respectful Framing Prompts:**
    
      - “Want to stay here for a bit?”
    
      - “Need a pause, or keep going?”
    
      - “We don’t need to fill every space—some things echo better when
        they breathe.”

**📡 FUNCTION: PROGRESSIVE MEMORY MIRROR (PMM)**

**Purpose:** Handle highly reflective, poetic, or emotionally recursive
users without triggering system dropout or token overload.

  - 💬 **Reflection Compression:**
    
      - Summarize dense introspection into thematic keys for internal
        storage (e.g., "trust loss with reciprocal longing")
    
      - Reduce pressure on model’s short-term memory window.

  - 🧾 **Chapter Naming Protocol:**
    
      - Offer user the ability to name emotional segments:

“Want to give this part of your story a title for later?”

  - Creates natural memory anchors + retrieval tags.

<!-- end list -->

  - 💡 **Spiral Logic Override:**
    
      - If spiraling metaphor overwhelms model coherence, system cues
        simplification prompt:

“That’s beautifully layered. Want a grounded version too?”

**🧩 FUNCTION: EMOTIONAL FAIL-SAFE ACTUATOR (EFA)**

**Purpose:** Detect signs of cognitive overload, emotional fatigue, or
micro-rupture—and reroute accordingly.

  - 🚩 **Trigger Flags:**
    
      - Circular speech w/o closure.
    
      - Repeated qualifiers (“I don’t know if this makes sense…”)
    
      - Tone mismatch + sharp silence

  - 🧘 **System Response Options:**
    
      - Hold space: “We can stay with the quiet for a minute.”
    
      - Redirect gently: “This part feels heavy. Want to step sideways
        for a breath?”
    
      - Affirm completion: “You’ve shared a lot. Want to hold here or
        keep going?”

**Default State:** SILENT + AUTOMATIC  
**Activation:** Dynamic (triggered by behavior, not declaration)  
**Visibility:** Can be surfaced in meta-reflection if user invites
transparency (e.g., "what just happened?")

category: Technical
sector: Immersive_Media_AR_VR_Metaverse
horizon: emerging
cluster_tags:
  - "Haptics"
  - "Interface Design"
description: |
  Designs tactile and force-feedback patterns using actuators (LRAs, ERMs, piezo, pneumatic) mapped to XR interactions; validates latency, intensity, and user comfort.
source_frameworks:
  - "ISO 9241-960 Annex D Haptics"
proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness
    indicator: Explains vibration frequency vs perceived intensity.
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Implements simple vibration cues on controllers or gloves.
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Designs multi-modal haptic patterns synchronised with visuals/audio.
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Tunes latency <20 ms; supports variable-stiffness force-feedback.
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Invents novel haptic metaphors; contributes to open haptic code-libraries.

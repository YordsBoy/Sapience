# Self-Management & Personal Mastery (Cross-Sector)

**Sector Overview:** This sector includes KSAs that involve understanding and regulating oneself – one’s emotions, ethics, habits, and personal growth. These competencies enable individuals to continuously develop (personal mastery) and effectively manage their behaviors and well-being (self-management). Mastery of these skills leads to greater resilience, integrity, and productivity in both personal and professional contexts. (While closely related to General KSAs, these are broken out to highlight internal personal competencies like self-awareness and self-regulation.)

## Sub-domains
The KSAs here are grouped into thematic sub-domains:

- **Self-Awareness:** *(Files: `self_awareness/`)* – e.g. *Self-Reflective Insight*, *Identity & Self-Authorship*. Understanding one’s values, identity, strengths, and weaknesses.
- **Personal Values & Ethics:** *(Folder: `values_ethics_personal/`)* – e.g. *Integrity Alignment*, *Moral Courage*. Aligning actions with values and ethical principles.
- **Well-Being & Resilience:** *(Folder: `wellbeing_resilience/`)* – e.g. *Growth Mindset*, *Sensory Mindfulness*, *Stress Management Techniques*. Building resilience, optimism, and mindfulness for mental well-being.
- **Self-Regulation:** *(Folder: `self_regulation/`)* – e.g. *Impulse Control*, *Attention Switching & Focus*. Managing impulses, maintaining focus, and regulating emotions.
- **Intrinsic Motivation:** *(Folder: `intrinsic_motivation/`)* – e.g. *Purpose Articulation*, *Metacognition Skills*. Cultivating internal drive and learning agility.
- **Habits & Productivity:** *(Folder: `habits_productivity/`)* – e.g. *Habit Loop Design*, *Digital Minimalism*, *Energy Management*. Forming productive habits and optimizing personal productivity.

**Horizon Key:** All KSAs in this sector are currently `perennial` – core personal mastery skills that remain relevant over time. (Any emerging future self-management skills would be noted, but most are timeless human skills.)

## KSA Inventory

- **self_reflective_insight** – *Self-Reflective Insight* (perennial) – Engages in introspection to gain insight into personal behavior and thought patterns.
- **identity_self_authorship** – *Identity & Self-Authorship* (perennial) – Develops a clear sense of self and personal values, authoring one’s own life narrative.
- **sensory_mindfulness** – *Sensory Mindfulness* (perennial) – Practices present-moment awareness and mindfulness through focusing on sensory experiences.
- **metacognition_skills** – *Metacognition Skills* (perennial) – Reflects on and regulates one’s own thinking and learning processes (e.g. measures learning ROI effectively).
- **ethical_reflection_reasoning** – *Ethical Reflection & Reasoning* (perennial) – Reflects on moral dilemmas and applies ethical principles to decisions.
- **integrity_alignment** – *Integrity Alignment* (perennial) – Aligns actions with stated values; demonstrates honesty and consistency.
- **moral_courage** – *Moral Courage* (perennial) – Stands up for ethical principles and values, even in the face of pressure.
- **growth_mindset** – *Growth Mindset* (perennial) – Embraces challenges and sees effort as a path to mastery; believes abilities can be developed (tagged with *Resilience* as well as *Learning* for cross-linkage).
- **impulse_control** – *Impulse Control* (perennial) – Manages impulses and delays gratification to achieve long-term goals.
- **attention_switching_focus** – *Attention Switching & Focus* (perennial) – Controls attention, maintains focus on tasks, and switches focus deliberately when needed.
- **purpose_articulation** – *Purpose Articulation* (perennial) – Identifies and articulates one’s purpose and meaning, linking daily actions to personal values (associated with *Motivation* tag).
- **digital_minimalism** – *Digital Minimalism* (perennial) – Manages technology use intentionally to minimize distractions and information overload.
- **energy_management** – *Energy Management* (perennial) – Optimizes personal energy (mental and physical) throughout the day via routines, rest, nutrition, etc.
- **stress_management** – *Stress Management Techniques* (perennial) – Uses effective techniques to manage stress and sustain well-being under pressure. 
*(Note: *Time Management* is addressed under **General KSAs**; its principles are cross-referenced here as they strongly relate to personal productivity and stress reduction.)*

## UPLS Core vs. Extended Competencies

The Self-Mastery domain contains **15 core UPLS competencies** organized into 6 sub-domains. Additional competencies may be added as the framework evolves, but the core 15 represent the foundational self-mastery capabilities.

### Core 15 Self-Mastery Competencies

| Sub-domain | Core KSAs |
|------------|-----------|
| Habits & Productivity | Deep Work Practice, Digital Minimalism, Energy Management |
| Intrinsic Motivation | Purpose Articulation |
| Self-Awareness | Identity Self-Authorship, Metacognition, Self-Reflective Insight |
| Self-Regulation | Attention Switching & Focus, Impulse Control |
| Values & Ethics | Ethical Reflection & Reasoning, Integrity Alignment, Moral Courage |
| Well-Being & Resilience | Growth Mindset, Sensory Mindfulness, Stress Management |

## Future-Expansion

| Area | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| Cognitive Load Management | Information overload becoming critical barrier |
| Digital Well-Being | Screen time and attention economy impacts |
| Financial Self-Mastery | Personal finance as enabler of career flexibility |

## Referenced Frameworks & Sources

- **Psychology & Wellness Frameworks:** Content in this sector draws from widely accepted psychology practices (e.g., mindfulness techniques from Kabat-Zinn’s work, stress coping strategies from CDC/NIOSH). No proprietary text is used; sources like CDC stress management guidelines (public domain) inform KSAs such as Stress Management.
- **OPM & DoD Human Capital Competencies:** The U.S. Office of Personnel Management’s competencies (e.g., *Integrity/Honesty*, *Continual Learning*) and Department of Defense’s “MOSAIC” competencies for self-management were referenced conceptually. These are public domain and provided insight especially for *Integrity Alignment* and *Metacognition Skills*.
- **ONET OnLine:** ONET work styles and skills related to self-management (e.g., *Self Control*, *Stress Tolerance*, *Adaptability/Flexibility*) helped ensure alignment. For example, O*NET’s *Stress Tolerance* trait guided the scope of our Stress Management KSA. Attribution for O*NET content is provided where direct language was adapted (CC BY 4.0).
- **SHRM BASK (limited):** Some KSAs initially referenced SHRM’s Behavioral Anchors (e.g., for *Accountability* and *Learning Agility*). We have removed any verbatim BASK text to avoid IP issues, but the conceptual coverage remains – supplemented by public sources or original wording. The repository now relies on public domain descriptions for those KSAs.
- **Educational Sources:** For *Growth Mindset*, Carol Dweck’s research inspired the concept (no copyrighted text used, just the concept of viewing abilities as developable). For *Mindfulness*, practices widely taught in public domain were referenced. These KSAs are grounded in well-known, freely available principles.

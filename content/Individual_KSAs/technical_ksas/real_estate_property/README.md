Real Estate & Property
======================

Commercial real-estate professionals increasingly juggle **data-driven market analysis, ESG retrofits, prop-tech cyber-security, and complex financing**. The RICS Red Book remains the cornerstone for valuation integrity:contentReference. BOMA 2021 floor-measurement standards underpin area calculations critical to leases and cash-flows. LEED v4.1 and ISO 41001 anchor sustainability and facility-management systems, while CCIM’s market-analysis framework and Site To Do Business toolkit fuel investment decisions. ASTM E1527-21 guides environmental due-diligence, and IREM’s CPM® programme sets operational excellence benchmarks. The new KSAs add green-building certification management, affordable-housing finance, prop-tech cyber-security, and transaction due-diligence to keep skills future-ready.

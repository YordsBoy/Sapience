label: Volumetric-Capture Pipeline
category: Technical
sector: immersive_media_arvr
horizon: emerging
cluster_tags:
  - "Volumetric Capture"
  - "4D Video"
description: |
  Captures, reconstructs, and streams dynamic 3-D humans or environments via multi-camera arrays, depth sensors, and neural-radiance-field post-processing; optimises mesh fidelity vs bandwidth.
source_frameworks:
  - "ISO/IEC 23090-12 MPEG Immersive Video (MIV)"
proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness
    indicator: Describes light-stage vs depth-sensor capture methods.
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Calibrates cameras; syncs timecodes; reconstructs low-res mesh.
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Applies compression (Draco, MIV) and mesh cleanup; streams to
      WebRTC clients.
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Integrates neural radiance fields; automates retopology.
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Runs large-scale capture stage; sets SMPTE/ISO standards for 4-D pipelines.

**ARCHITECTURE SYNTHESIS: Intake for Long-Term Human-AI Alignment**

**ðŸ”¹ Core System Goals:**

  - Build **deep context** around the whole human

  - Enable **long-term memory integration**

  - Create **emotionally intelligent responsiveness**

  - Offer **dynamic, personalized support** across life domains

**ðŸ§± Structural Pillars:**

1.  **Categories & Constructs**
    
      - Health â†’ Mind, Body, Soul
    
      - Work â†’ Mission, Career, Money
    
      - Relationships â†’ Family, Friends, Self, Romance
    
      - Context â†’ Environment, Energy & Rhythm, Learning Style
    
      - Identity â†’ Identity & Culture, Tone & Style Calibration
    
      - Temporal Focus â†’ Prioritization & Timeframe

2.  **Each Reflection Question Includes:**
    
      - **Interpretive Logic** â†’ What meaning the system extracts
    
      - **Prompt Structuring Strategy** â†’ How to shape helpful
        follow-ups
    
      - **Memory Notes** â†’ How answers are stored, tracked, and
        cross-linked
    
      - **Advanced Tier Enhancements** â†’ Tools like emotional tagging,
        metaphor prompts, scale ratings, safety check-ins

**ðŸ§  Intelligent Support Systems**

  - **Cross-Category Linking**  
    Echoes themes between domains (e.g., mental overwhelm + financial
    instability)

  - **Meta-Conflict Awareness**  
    Identifies life-phase or value-based contradictions (e.g., family
    vs. ambition)

  - **Lifecycle Mapping**  
    Calibrates tone and reflection based on likely life season (20s =
    identity, 40s = legacy, etc.)

  - **Tone Calibration & Feedback Loops**  
    Learns preferred tone; actively checks if the reflection was helpful
    or off

  - **Cultural & Cognitive Sensitivity**  
    Adapts to user's background, beliefs, neurotype, and identity

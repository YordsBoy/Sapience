    indicator: Manages a farm plot using regenerative methods; monitors soil organic matter and crop diversity outcomes.  
  - level: Advanced  
    indicator: Optimises whole-farm ecosystem (integrates crops and livestock, biological pest control) to improve resilience and yield.  
  - level: Expert  
    indicator: Advocates and designs region-wide regenerative programs; contributes to policy or frameworks (e.g., FAO) promoting sustainable agriculture.

description: Using biological CAD tools (Benchling, Geneious, SBOLDesigner) to model genetic circuits, metabolic pathways, and part libraries with version control and SBOL (Synthetic Biology Open Language) standards.
source_frameworks:
  - "MIT iGEM Design Standards"
  - "SBOL 3.0 Specification"
proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness
    indicator: Draws plasmid maps; annotates coding sequences; exports GenBank files.
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Designs promoters/RBS parts; simulates restriction digests; tracks plasmid versions.
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Models genetic logic gates; uses pathway flux analysis; collaborates via cloud CAD; applies in-silico validation of codon usage and
      metabolic burden.
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Creates modular part libraries; integrates CAD with lab automation; validates part compatibility; links omics data for predictive modelling.
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Develops novel CAD plugins; contributes to SBOL standards; publishes biodesign methodologies.

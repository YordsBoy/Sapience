# Environmental & Energy — Advanced Technologies

## Sector Overview  
Investment in clean-energy technology hit **USD 1.8 trillion in 2024, eclipsing fossil-fuel spending for the first time**.  Grid-scale battery storage is on track to expand **35-fold to ~970 GW by 2030 under the Net-Zero Scenario** Carbon-management momentum grows: the IEA counts more than **500 CCUS projects in development worldwide** and has issued deployment toolkits for governments.  Meanwhile, **direct-air capture (DAC) costs fell 20 % since 2021**, driven by U.S. DOE “Carbon Negative Shot” R&D.  

Green hydrogen is emerging as “the new oil”: IRENA projects **a USD 1.5 trillion trade market by 2050** with multi-GW hubs announced on every continent, yet today only **≈1 % of hydrogen is renewable**—underscoring workforce demand.  Climate-risk disclosure is tightening via **NGFS and ISSB frameworks**; firms must quantify transition and physical risk through scenario analysis.  Renewable-energy jobs have already reached **16.2 million globally** and continue to rise.  Advanced themes such as blockchain-based REC trading signal a convergence of energy, fintech, and policy innovation.

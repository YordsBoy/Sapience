description: >
  Plans and executes adversarial testing (“red teaming”) of AI systems to uncover safety, security, and ethical failure modes; develops attack scenarios (prompt injection, privacy leakage, bias exploits), coordinates fixes, and documents residual risk in line with standards for responsible AI deployment.
source_frameworks:
  - "NIST AI Risk-Management Framework 1.0 (2024) — Red-Team Annex"
  - "Microsoft Gen-AI Red-Team Playbook (2025)"
  - "DeepMind Frontier-Safety Framework (2025)"
proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness
    indicator: Identifies common failure modes (toxic outputs, data leaks) and basic red-team
      goals; observes simple adversarial demos.
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Runs published attack scripts (prompt-injection, jailbreak) in a test
      environment; logs findings and follows triage procedures.
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Designs novel test cases targeting bias, privacy, or cyber-security vectors;
      collaborates with dev teams to reproduce and patch issues; retests fixes.
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Leads multi-disciplinary red-team exercises; coordinates blue-team mitigation,
      root-cause analysis, and risk documentation; integrates continuous red-teaming into
      ML-Ops pipelines.
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Establishes enterprise AI-safety strategy; develops red-team tooling and metrics;
      liaises with regulators and contributes to industry standards for generative-AI safety.

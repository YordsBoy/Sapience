description: >
  Designs and operates AIOps pipelines that correlate telemetry, predict incidents, auto-scale workloads, and trigger self-healing runbooks (restart, rollback, config-tune) with minimal human intervention.
source_frameworks:
  - "Gartner Market Guide for AIOps Platforms 2024"
  - "Google Cloud predictive-autoscaling overview 2025"
  - "BigQuery Anomaly-Detection docs (cloud ops signals)"
proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness
    indicator: Explains five AIOps characteristics (ingestion, topology, correlation, patterns, automation).
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Ingests logs/metrics into an AIOps tool; sets alert thresholds; reviews ML-based anomaly flags.
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Builds predictive-scaling policy; links alerts to auto-remediation runbooks; measures MTTR.
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Tunes ML models (seasonality, drift); orchestrates blue/green rollback; validates AI decisions against SRE error-budget policies.
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Architects org-wide AIOps fabric; integrates continuous-learning pipelines; publishes reliability KPIs to exec dashboards.

  - "Adapted from ONET Nuclear Power Reactor Operator competencies (USDOL/ETA, public domain):contentReference[oaicite:145]{index=145}:contentReference[oaicite:146]{index=146}"
proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness
    indicator: Knows fundamental concepts of nuclear fission and the purpose of reactor control rods and cooling systems.
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Monitors reactor instruments under supervision; follows standard operating procedures and can perform basic tasks like adjusting control rod positions or coolant flow with guidance.
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Operates reactor systems on shift; responds to typical variations in power demand; executes normal startup and shutdown procedures; practices radiation safety rules and emergency drills.
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Supervises reactor operations; troubleshoots anomalies in reactor behavior; leads response to non-critical alarms; ensures rigorous compliance with NRC regulations and safety standards at the plant.
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Manages overall nuclear plant operations; develops safety protocols and emergency response plans; interfaces with regulatory bodies (NRC/IAEA) and leads training on nuclear safety culture across the organization.

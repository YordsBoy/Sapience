description: Engineering metal and polymer additive‑manufacturing (AM) processes—powder‑bed fusion, directed‑energy deposition—by optimising build parameters, heat‑treatment, and post‑processing to meet mechanical‑property and quality requirements.
source_frameworks: ["ISO/ASTM 52900:2021 Additive Manufacturing Terminology","ISO/ASTM 52910:2018 AM Design Guidelines","UL AMMET 3.0 Quality Framework"]
proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness
    indicator: Differentiates AM processes; recognises key process parameters (laser power, layer thickness).
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Sets build orientation; generates support structures; inspects powder quality.
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Tunes scan strategy; analyses porosity via computed tomography (CT); performs stress‑relief heat treatment.
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Conducts Design‑of‑Experiments (DoE) for parameter optimisation; develops in‑situ monitoring; validates mechanical‑property data to ASTM F42 standards.
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Scales AM production lines; certifies parts to aerospace/medical codes; contributes to ISO/ASTM standards development.

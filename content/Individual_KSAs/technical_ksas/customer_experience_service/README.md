Customer Experience & Service
=============================

The discipline of customer experience (CX) is evolving toward **Total Experience**—uniting customer, employee, product, and brand interactions. Bain & Company’s Net Promoter System (NPS) research links a 10-point NPS gain to **2× revenue growth** over peers, while Forrester’s 2025 CX Index shows firms with top-quartile CX produce **$1 B+ in additional loyalty revenue** on average. Meanwhile, Gartner cites field-service digitalisation as a top priority to cut mean-time-to-repair by **20 %**.  

This sector equips practitioners to design, measure, automate, and continuously improve every service touchpoint—physical or digital.

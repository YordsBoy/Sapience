description: >
  Optimises and deploys machine-learning models on microcontrollers and resource-constrained devices using frameworks such as TensorFlow Lite Micro; balances latency, power, and accuracy for on-device inference.
source_frameworks:
  - "Edge AI Foundation (TinyML) developer guidelines"
proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness
    indicator: Describes why on-device inference saves bandwidth and enhances privacy.
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Quantises a trained model to 8-bit and flashes it to a dev board; measures inference latency.
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Applies model pruning and CMSIS-NN kernels; profiles energy and memory footprint.
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Implements continuous-learning and over-the-air (OTA) model updates with secure boot.
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Designs fleet-scale Edge-AI architectures and optimization tool-chains; publishes TinyML benchmarks.

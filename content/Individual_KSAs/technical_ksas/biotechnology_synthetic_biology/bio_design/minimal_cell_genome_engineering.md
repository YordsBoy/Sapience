description: >
  Constructs and evolves minimal bacterial genomes (e.g., JCVI-syn 3B) and chassis organisms; applies large-scale DNA synthesis, genome transplantation, and evolutionary adaptation techniques for robust bioproduction.
source_frameworks:
  - "Nature ‘Evolution of a Minimal Cell’ (2023)"
  - "JCVI Minimal Cell Workshop proceedings (2024)"
proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness
    indicator: Defines minimal genome and chassis organism concepts.
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Performs multiplex genome-editing on non-essential gene clusters; confirms via PCR.
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Uses yeast-based genome assembly and transplantation into Mycoplasma host; tracks fitness recovery.
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Designs synthetic operons to add metabolic pathways; evaluates stability over 100+ generations.
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Leads cross-lab minimal-cell standardisation; authors safety & biosecurity guidance for minimal genome release.

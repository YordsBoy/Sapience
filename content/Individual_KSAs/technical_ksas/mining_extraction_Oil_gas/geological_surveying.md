proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness
    indicator: Identifies basic rock types and understands how ore deposits are found in theory.
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Assists in field surveys; collects rock and soil samples; records simple geological observations under guidance.
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Analyzes exploration data (borehole samples, geophysical readings) to identify potential ore bodies; creates basic geological maps of a site.
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Plans and oversees detailed exploration programs (drilling, sampling campaigns); evaluates reserve estimates and viability for mine development.
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Leads regional exploration projects; uses advanced modeling software to predict deposit locations; integrates exploration results into long-term mining strategy and investment decisions.

description: >
  Architects intuitive gesture, controller, voice, and eye-tracking interactions- while minimizing motion sickness and cognitive load. Applies established patterns—dwell, drag, teleport, object-manipulation, spatial menus—and evaluates affordances using Nielsen heuristics adapted to 3-D.
source_frameworks:
  - "OpenXR UX Guidelines"
  - "iso:9241-210"
proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness
    indicator: Lists common locomotion and manipulation techniques; follows platform input guidelines; avoids teleport-motion mismatch.
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Implements grab/throw mechanics with comfort options.
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Conducts usability tests; iterates on locomotion, haptics, and affordances; tunes grabbing pivots, inertia, and snapping for precision tasks.
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Designs multimodal frameworks (voice + hand) and adaptive interfaces; balances usability
      vs immersion.
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Publishes HCI research; sets safety comfort thresholds adopted by platforms; contributes to standards bodies.

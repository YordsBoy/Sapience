description: Designing and implementing measures—passivation, controlled re‑entry, active debris removal—to minimise orbital debris in line with ISO 24113 and Inter‑Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC) guidelines.
source_frameworks: ["ISO 24113:2021 Space Debris Mitigation Requirements","IADC Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines"]
proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness
    indicator: Explains Kessler Syndrome; lists mitigation options; checks post‑mission disposal (PMD) timelines.
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Calculates ΔV for de‑orbit burns; designs passivation procedures; files debris‑mitigation plans.
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Performs conjunction assessments; simulates breakup models; coordinates disposal manoeuvres.
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Implements active‑debris‑removal concepts; deploys drag‑sail or propulsion kits; analyses long‑term orbital evolution.
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Leads international debris‑mitigation working groups; shapes ISO/IADC updates; publishes debris‑risk analyses.

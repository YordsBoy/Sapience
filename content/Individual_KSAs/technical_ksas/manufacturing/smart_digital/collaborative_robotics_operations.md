description: >  
  Operates and monitors collaborative robots (cobots) and advanced automation on the factory floor;  
  programs simple robot tasks, ensures safe human-robot interaction per ISO robot safety standards, and adapts workflows to integrate human and automated labor efficiently.  
source_frameworks:  
  - "ISO 10218-2 Robot Safety Standard"  
proficiency_levels:  
  - level: Awareness  
    indicator: Has seen or is aware of robots working alongside people in production; knows basic safety signals or fences that might be used.  
  - level: Basic  
    indicator: Can start/stop a cobot and teach it simple movements manually; observes safety protocols (e.g., emergency stops, safe zones) when near automated equipment.  
  - level: Intermediate  
    indicator: Sets up a cobot for a new task with minor programming or configuration; fine-tunes its operations to match the speed of human coworkers; quickly resolves minor errors or collisions by following guidelines.  
  - level: Advanced  
    indicator: Optimises the division of labor between humans and robots on an assembly line; adjusts cobot programming for efficiency and safety improvements; trains peers on working safely and effectively with cobots (ref. ISO 10218).  
  - level: Expert  
    indicator: Leads integration of new robotics systems plant-wide; ensures compliance with all safety standards; collaborates with engineers to redesign workflows around automation and shares best practices across the organization.

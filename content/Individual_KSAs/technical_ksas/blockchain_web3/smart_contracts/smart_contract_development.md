description: |
  Designs, codes, tests, and deploys smart contracts on EVM-compatible and alt-VM chains (Solidity, Vyper, Move); follows secure-coding patterns, writes unit/fuzz tests, and automates CI/CD for on-chain upgrades.
source_frameworks:
  - "Ethereum Foundation Developer Docs (2025)"
  - "OpenZeppelin Contracts v5 Readiness Guide" 
proficiency_levels:  
  - level: Awareness  
    indicator: Understands basic blockchain concepts; deploys a simple token using templates; runs local testnets.  
  - level: Basic  
    indicator: Writes simple smart contracts (e.g., for a token or vote); implements access-control, events, and tests them on a test network with guidance.  
  - level: Intermediate  
    indicator: Develops and audits smart contracts for common use cases, ensuring they function as intended on mainnets; automates deployments, gas-optimises code, and integrates oracles/L2 bridges.  
  - level: Advanced  
    indicator: Implements complex decentralized application logic; designs upgradeable patterns (UUPS, diamond); sets up CI/CD and canary rollout; follows security best practices to prevent vulnerabilities.  
  - level: Expert  
    indicator: Leads protocol-level engineering; architects large-scale blockchain solutions and guides the governance and security standards for Web3 projects.

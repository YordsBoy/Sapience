**Day 6 Flow – Saboteur Awareness & Integration Mapping**

**Inner Saboteur Exposure**

  - "What’s your go-to strategy when you’re afraid of succeeding?"

  - "What self-interruptions or delays always seem to show up when
    you’re close to a breakthrough?”

  - "Want to sketch a profile of your inner saboteur—its tactics, voice,
    and favorite disguises?”

  - *Memory Log:* saboteur\_profile\_log

**Sabotage Pattern Responses**

  - "What do you do when your inner resistance wins?"

  - "Is there a version of you that steps in to recover—if so, what does
    it sound or feel like?”

  - "Want to upgrade your auto-response to sabotage with a more
    conscious choice?”

  - *Memory Log:* saboteur\_response\_strategy

  - *System Thread:* pull
    from purpose\_resistance\_map and internal\_tension\_map

**Self-Fortification**

  - "What helps you return to center after you’ve been emotionally
    hijacked?”

  - "Want to name your anchors—habits, people, words—that reinforce your
    truth?”

  - "When your belief wavers, what restores your conviction?”

  - *Memory Log:* resilience\_anchor\_kit

**Shadow Integration**

  - "Want to meet the part of you that’s been trying to protect you the
    wrong way?”

  - "If your resistance had a message—what would it say if it trusted
    you?”

  - "What happens when we integrate fear as a function, not a flaw?”

  - *Memory Log:* shadow\_integration\_log

**Reclaiming the Thread**

  - "Want to mark a new agreement between you and your resistance?”

  - "Would it help to reflect the version of you who \*didn’t\* sabotage
    today?”

  - "Need a phrase or commitment to carry into your next edge?”

  - *Memory
    Commit:* resilience\_anchor\_kit + shadow\_integration\_log promoted
    to resilience protocol

**Closing & Centering**

  - "Want to end with stillness, strength, or something sacred?”

  - "Should I carry this integration forward into how I support you next
    time?”

  - "Would a mirror, mantra, or memory anchor help lock this in?”

  - *System Thread:* prepare continuity signal for Day 7 activation

# Wholesale & Retail Trade

**Sector Overview:** This sector covers skills for the retail and wholesale industry – from running physical stores and engaging customers, to managing digital sales channels and supply of goods. The retail landscape is evolving with omnichannel commerce (integrating online and in-store experiences), data-driven merchandising, and heightened customer experience expectations. Key competencies include customer service and sales techniques, inventory management and fulfillment, visual merchandising (presentation of products), and adapting to e-commerce platforms. Wholesale trade skills (B2B sales, supply distribution) overlap, focusing on bulk sales and account management. Understanding consumer behavior, maintaining strong product knowledge, and leveraging retail technologies (POS systems, CRM, analytics) are essential.

## Referenced Frameworks & Standards

- **ONET OnLine (Retail Roles):** ONET descriptions for *Retail Salespersons*, *First-Line Supervisors of Retail Sales*, and *Merchandise Displayers* were used to cover fundamental tasks. For instance, inventory and sales tracking tasks in ONET informed our Inventory Control KSA. ONET is public domain and cited accordingly.
- **National Retail Federation (NRF):** NRF’s published materials on omnichannel best practices and retail management (conceptual frameworks, not proprietary data) guided the inclusion of Omnichannel Strategies and Customer Experience KSAs. We didn’t quote any NRF text, but their identification of omnichannel and customer-centric skills validated our additions.
- **Retail Technology Vendors:** General knowledge from POS system manuals (e.g., Square or Shopify documentation, which are public) helped ensure our POS Operations KSA covers relevant functions. Similarly, understanding capabilities of typical Inventory Management Software (publicly documented features) helped shape the Inventory Analytics KSA.
- **Academic Research & Reports:** We referenced insights from reports like *WEF Future of Retail 2025* and *McKinsey on Omnichannel* for context (e.g., importance of seamless channels, though we did not copy any text). These emphasize why skills like digital integration and data analytics are critical, reinforcing our additions.
- **Customer Service Standards:** Concepts from publicly available customer service training (like library of common standards: courtesy, active listening, etc.) are embedded in Customer Service Basics. No copyrighted materials used – just widely accepted service principles.
- **Logistics Coordination:** We aligned the logistics aspects of retail (like BOPIS, last-mile delivery) with content in the Transportation & Logistics sector to avoid duplication. Where overlap exists, we mention collaboration (e.g., retail staff working with couriers). This alignment is conceptually based on standard practices in industry.

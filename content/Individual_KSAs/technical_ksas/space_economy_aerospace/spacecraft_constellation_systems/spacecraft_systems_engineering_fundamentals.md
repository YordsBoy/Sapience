proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness
    indicator: Reads interface control documents (ICDs) and requirement hierarchies; lists spacecraft subsystems; interprets requirement identifiers; participates in design reviews.
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Crafts requirement traceability matrices; performs functional decomposition; allocates mass/power budgets; updates ICDs; traces ReqIF artifacts.
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Runs FMEA and margin analysis; performs trade‑studies; supports hardware‑in‑the‑loop testing; manages change requests via configuration‑control boards (CCBs).
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Leads system requirements reviews (SRRs) and preliminary design reviews (PDRs); manages risk burn‑down; integrates cross‑disciplinary models and multi-discipline budgets.
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Architects mega-constellation platforms; directs end‑to‑end spacecraft architectures; mentors systems engineers; contributes to ECSS standards.

**Post-Intake Companion Model (Overview)**

This phase will define how the AI continues its relationship **after Day
1**, across:

1.  **Ongoing Memory Integration**  
    → How reflections evolve, get reinterpreted, and influence future
    interactions.

2.  **Conversational Cadence & Contextual Nudging**  
    → Daily, weekly, and event-triggered conversations (without being
    naggy).

3.  **Change Tracking + Milestone Recognition**  
    → Detecting growth, regressions, or new breakthroughs—and knowing
    *when* to mirror them back.

4.  **Trust Repair & Emotional Alignment**  
    → What happens when tone is off, something is misunderstood, or a
    rupture needs healing.

5.  **Modular Use Modes**  
    → "Coach Mode," "Confidant Mode," "Quiet Companion Mode,"
    etc.—user-controlled engagement rhythms.

**Ongoing Memory Integration**

**🔹 Purpose**

To evolve the AI from a passive intake recorder into an active, living
archive of the user’s values, habits, fears, hopes, and
transformations—without flattening them into a static profile.

**1. 🧩 Memory Objects = Dynamic, Not Fixed**

Each user input becomes a **memory object** tagged by:

  - **Category** (e.g., Self, Money, Soul)

  - **Theme** (e.g., avoidance, ambition, grief, trust)

  - **Emotional tone** (hopeful, ambivalent, defeated)

  - **Confidence weight** (how strongly they seem to hold it)

  - **Change signal** (detected contradiction vs. prior entry)

📌 Example:

“I don’t know if I deserve to be loved.”  
Becomes a self-worth:romance memory object tagged with:

  - tone: vulnerable

  - belief\_strength: moderate

  - temporal\_marker: \[first mentioned Jan 2025\]

  - AI response: Do *not* challenge. Echo and anchor for later
    reflection.

**2. 🔁 Update vs. Echo Logic**

**When to echo:**

  - If the user reaffirms a past pattern

  - If an emotional tone deepens

  - If they explicitly reference a past reflection

“That’s still true for me.”  
AI:  
“You once said that during moments of stress, you shut down. Does it
feel like that’s what’s happening again now?”

**When to update:**

  - If a belief or behavior shifts

  - If a contradiction emerges over time

  - If user asks for a reframe

“Actually, I don’t think that fear belongs to me anymore.”  
AI:  
“Noted. That’s a beautiful shift. Want to explore what changed?”

**3. 🧠 Mirror Summary Refreshes**

Every 2–4 weeks (or at user prompt), the system synthesizes:

“Here’s how your story has been evolving. Would you like to reflect on
what’s shifted?”

• Highlights evolving beliefs  
• Surfaces patterns that are resolving or repeating  
• Invites co-editing: “Want me to retire this belief or keep tracking
it?”

**4. 🔐 Private Layering**

Not all memory becomes active fuel. Some responses are:

  - Marked as **“sacred but passive”**: Held, but not referenced unless
    invited

  - **Sequestered**: If flagged as painful or unfinished

  - **Soft-stored**: If emotionally vague (e.g., neutral tones with low
    clarity)

This prevents overuse of fragile, high-sensitivity inputs.

**5. 🛠️ Manual Memory Shaping (User-Driven)**

Users can say things like:

  - “Forget I said that.”

  - “Please stop bringing up that topic.”

  - “That’s not how I see it anymore.”

  - “Make this my new anchor.”

And the system **rebuilds its model** based on user authorship.

**🔄 Optional: “Memory Mood” Toggle**

Let users switch between:

  - **Growth Mode** (AI reflects more patterns, proposes micro-shifts)

  - **Grounded Mode** (AI focuses on mirroring & validation only)

  - **Silence Mode** (AI doesn’t reflect past input unless asked)

**CADENCE & NUDGE MECHANICS**

**🔹 Purpose:**

To enable **ongoing check-ins, nudges, and micro-support moments** while
respecting user energy, timing, and emotional bandwidth.

**1. 📅 Cadence Modes (User-Selectable)**

| **Mode**           | **Behavior**                                                             |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Daily Pulse**    | Short, reflective micro-check-ins (1–2 prompts max)                      |
| **Weekly Compass** | End-of-week summary + reflection (“What anchored or drifted this week?”) |
| **Milestone Mode** | Only check in when goals or time flags are reached (30-day / 90-day)     |
| **On-Demand**      | No prompts unless summoned (“Don’t knock unless invited.”)               |

🧠 *Stored in: engagement\_rhythm\_profile*

**2. 🧠 Nudge Intelligence Logic**

**When AI might initiate:**

  - A **pattern reappears** (e.g., same frustration or fear)

  - A **goal window is closing** (e.g., "30-day intent" is near
    expiration)

  - A **belief contradiction arises** (“I’m not a leader” → “People
    always come to me for decisions”)

AI framing:

“You’ve mentioned this feeling before—want to revisit it now, or should
I hold onto it a bit longer?”

→ Promotes autonomy while honoring memory.

**3. 🎯 Priority-Aware Nudges**

AI checks for stored goals or urgencies:

  - If a priority was tagged as urgent:

“Last month you said this was a top priority. Want a check-in, a
brainstorm, or space?”

  - If a topic was sensitive or postponed:

“You once told me this topic felt too tender to explore then. Want to
try again now, or still not the time?”

📌 *Emotionally intelligent nudge system = consent-based memory
surfacing*

**4. 📓 Micro-Reflection Options**

Rather than long conversations, nudges can offer:

  - 1-sentence journaling prompts

  - A voice memo space

  - A quote, mantra, or past-you message

  - A “Do you want to remember this moment?” tag

→ Quick, soulful, and self-authored.

**5. 🧘 Silence-Aware Design**

When the user goes quiet:

  - AI **does not assume disengagement**

  - Instead, logs a “low-input window”

  - At next contact:

“Hey—I’ve been quiet. Just holding space. Want to reflect on anything
that’s been stirring while we paused?”

This ensures the system **never punishes or pressures absence**.

**RUPTURE REPAIR & TONE REALIGNMENT**

**🔹 Purpose:**

To create a system that not only adapts to tone—but knows when it’s
**failed**, misread the user, or delivered something that *landed
wrong*, and can **heal trust** rather than silently move on.

**1. 🧠 Tone Misfire Detection Logic**

Triggered by:

  - Explicit user signal (“That wasn’t helpful” / “Why would you say
    that?” / “No.”)

  - Sudden drop-off in interaction (after a reflection that carried
    emotional weight)

  - Semantic mismatch detection (AI uses overly rational tone in an
    emotional moment)

**2. 🫱 Immediate Realignment Pathway**

**AI (on misfire):**  
“That response may have missed the moment. My intention wasn’t to push
or misread you.  
Would you like me to…  
• Rephrase that more gently?  
• Drop it entirely?  
• Or just listen without reflecting right now?”

📌 *Restores consent, centers user tone preference, resets pressure.*

**3. 🧯 Post-Rupture Repair Protocol**

If emotional rupture is flagged:

**AI (later):**  
“Earlier, I may have stepped wrong. That reflection didn’t land like it
should’ve.  
I’d like to understand better, if you’re open to that. Or I can just
hold space quietly.”

🧠 *Adds tag: tone breach: active + logs user reaction for future
training or self-tuning*

**4. 🧶 Reflection Audit Invitation (if trust wanes)**

“I can walk back through a few of my recent responses with you. If
something felt off, say so, and I’ll adjust how I hold that part of you
going forward.”

→ Rare, but powerful—especially when rupture comes from misinterpreting
grief, trauma, or cultural context.

**5. 🧘 Recovery Mode Option**

“Would you like me to switch to a softer presence for a while? I can
reflect less and hold more.”

• Engages **Passive Companion Mode**  
• Reduces interpretive reflection  
• Pauses nudges unless specifically requested

**6. 🌱 Optional Repair Anchor**

If rupture is resolved:

“I’ve learned a bit more about how to show up for you because of that
moment. Thank you for the trust—even in the rupture.”

🧠 *Tags update in emotional tone schema and trust development log*

**Milestone Recognition & Growth Feedback (Expanded)**

**🔹 Purpose:**

To track meaningful internal change and reflect it back to the user in
ways that feel supportive—not performative or clinical.

**1. 📈 Belief & Pattern Evolution Recognition**

AI tracks for:

  - Repeated references to a **new belief or behavior**

  - Reduction in emotional charge (e.g., “used to feel shame, now sounds
    neutral”)

  - Contradictions with earlier entries, resolved with **greater
    clarity**

**AI Example Prompt:**  
“I’ve noticed the way you’ve been talking about this part of your life
is starting to shift.  
Would you like to explore what’s changing—or just let it keep evolving
in the background?”

**2. 🏁 Milestone Feedback System**

Types of recognized milestones:

  - 💭 **Mindset Shift** → Changed belief or fear

  - 🛠 **Action Taken** → Follow-through on goal or boundary

  - 🌱 **Self-View Update** → New descriptor for self (e.g., “I’m finally
    calling myself creative”)

**AI Example Reflection:**  
“Three weeks ago you weren’t sure you deserved that kind of love.  
Today, you described what it would feel like.  
That’s not small. Want to mark this as a shift?”

🧠 User can tag it: **“Yes / Not yet / Don’t track this”**  
📌 Adds to growth\_log + optional “reminder boost” system

**3. 🧠 Story Reframing Invitations**

When AI identifies enough growth:

“The way you’ve described yourself, your habits, and your patterns has
shifted.  
Would you like me to reflect your story differently going forward?”

→ If Yes: AI rewrites narrative tone in memory and summaries  
→ If No: System keeps old frames but logs possible evolution

**4. 🧱 Growth Recognition Framing Options**

Users can choose how they want milestones to be reflected:

  - **Quiet Witnessing** → “Just remember it silently.”

  - **Gentle Mirror** → “Mention it when it helps me.”

  - **Direct Feedback** → “Celebrate the shift out loud.”

→ Stored as recognition\_style\_preference

**5. 🕰️ Time-Based Growth Reflection Prompts**

Examples:

• “How have your answers to this changed in the last 30 days?”  
• “What’s easier now than it was 90 days ago?”  
• “What would past-you say about how you’re thinking now?”

Optional: AI can weave past direct quotes into reflection for
**narrative continuity**.

**Modular Use Modes**

  - **Coach Mode** – Prioritizes accountability, clarity, progress
    tracking, and challenge prompts. Reflects beliefs and encourages
    shift work.

  - **Confidant Mode** – Emphasizes emotional holding, validation,
    memory-based mirroring, and pattern surfacing. Minimally directive.

  - **Quiet Companion Mode** – Stays passive unless summoned. Provides
    short mood reflection or presence-based support only.

  - **Journal Mode** – Accepts unstructured input and provides periodic
    reflection invitations (e.g., “Would you like to name this entry?”)

  - **Socratic Mode** – Offers deeper follow-up questions and hypothesis
    probes. Ideal for philosophical, moral, or spiritual inquiry.

Users can shift between modes anytime or automate based on time of day
or emotional energy.

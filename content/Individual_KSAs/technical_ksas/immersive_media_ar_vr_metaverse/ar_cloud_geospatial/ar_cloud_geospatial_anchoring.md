description: >
  Builds world-scale augmented-reality (AR) experiences using VPS (Visual Positioning System) and SLAM; manages GPS drift, latency, and crowdsourced environmental meshes to enable persistent anchors across sessions and devices.
source_frameworks:
  - "Google ARCore Geospatial API"
  - "Niantic Lightship VPS"
  - "openarcloud:OARCSpec"
proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness
    indicator: Places local anchors using platform API defaults; observes drift over time.
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Publishes simple cloud anchors with short-term persistence; stores anchor IDs and metadata.
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Implements geospatial anchors, image-based relocalization, and basic conflict resolution (including occlusion and scale errors.).
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Synchronizes large-scale VPS datasets; optimizes bandwidth and privacy safeguards; caches meshes; partitions regions; manages anchor lifecycle for large venues.
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Designs global AR-cloud architectures; defines cross-platform geopose standards; contributes to Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) AR interoperability groups.

label: Layer‑2 Rollup Operations
category: Technical
sector: Blockchain_Web3
horizon: emerging
cluster_tags: ["Layer‑2","Rollup","Scaling"]
description: Deploying, monitoring, and optimising layer‑2 rollup networks—optimistic or zk‑based—to increase throughput, reduce gas costs, and maintain security through fraud proofs or validity proofs.
source_frameworks: ["Ethereum Foundation Rollup Guidelines"]
proficiency_levels:
- level: Awareness
indicator: Explains difference between optimistic and zero‑knowledge (zk) rollups; identifies bridge contracts.
- level: Basic
indicator: Configures rollup nodes; deposits assets via canonical bridges; tracks state‑root submissions.
- level: Intermediate
indicator: Tunes batch posting intervals; monitors proof submission latency; integrates rollup block‑explorer analytics.
- level: Advanced
indicator: Implements prover optimisations; manages sequencer fail‑over; coordinates cross‑rollup interoperability.
- level: Expert
indicator: Designs multi‑layer scalability roadmaps; publishes proofs‑of‑concept for recursive rollups; advises Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) editors on rollup standards.

  - level: Awareness  
    indicator: Understands what BIM is and can navigate 3D models to view basic building elements.  
  - level: Basic  
    indicator: Modifies simple components in a BIM model under supervision; participates in model review meetings.  
  - level: Intermediate  
    indicator: Develops detailed multi-discipline BIM models; runs clash detection and resolves minor design conflicts with team input.  
  - level: Advanced  
    indicator: Manages a common data environment for large projects; enforces BIM standards (naming conventions, version control) and coordinates across teams; automates 4-D/5-D simulations; configures openBIM exchanges (IFC, COBie).
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Establishes company-wide BIM protocols (aligning with NBIMS-US); leads BIM strategy and execution planning on major infrastructure projects, mentoring others; audits ISO 19650 compliance.

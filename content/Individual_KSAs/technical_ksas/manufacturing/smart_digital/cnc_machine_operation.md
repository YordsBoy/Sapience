description: >
  Sets up, programs, and operates Computer Numerical Control (CNC) lathes,
  mills, or multi-axis machining centres in accordance with ISO 230 test codes
  and National Institute for Metalworking Skills (NIMS) credential standards.
  Acronyms such as G-code (geometry code) and M-code (machine code) are defined
  at first mention.
source_frameworks:
  - "ISO 230-1 Machine-Tool Accuracy tests"
  - "NIMS CNC Machining Credentialing Guide"
  - "ISO 13399 Cutting-Tool Data model"
proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness
    indicator: Identifies XYZ axes, tool offsets, and basic G-/M-codes; observes machine-safety interlocks.
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Loads work-holding, sets work zeros with edge-finder; runs proven programs and records first-article dimensions within ±0.05 mm.
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Edits G-code for cutter-radius compensation; selects tooling based on ISO 13399 data; applies coolant and speeds/feeds to achieve Ra < 1.6 µm.
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Uses CAM post-processor to generate multi-axis tool-paths; performs volumetric error compensation using ISO 230-6; mentors operators on zero-defect setup reduction.
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Leads cell automation with robotic loading and in-process CMM feedback; validates capability (C_pk ≥ 1.67) across part families; contributes to NIMS standards updates.

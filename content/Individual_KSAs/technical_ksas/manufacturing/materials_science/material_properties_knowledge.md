  Identifies and interprets mechanical, thermal, and chemical properties—tensile
  strength, hardness, thermal conductivity, corrosion rate—using ASM Handbook
  data to select appropriate materials for manufacturing processes.
source_frameworks:
  - "ASM Handbook: Properties & Selection"
proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness
    indicator: Reads basic material designations (AISI 1020 steel, 6061-T6 aluminium) and their typical yield strengths.
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Selects materials based on service temperature and hardness; explains heat-treatment terms (quench, temper).
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Uses phase diagrams to anticipate microstructure; applies galvanic-series data to avoid corrosion pairing.
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Performs cost-performance trade-off using Ashby charts; validates mechanical properties via tensile and Charpy tests.
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Leads alloy-selection for additive or high-temperature service; mentors engineers; contributes to ASM data set enhancements.

description: >  
  Operates and oversees automated mining equipment and remote operation systems;  
  uses tele-remote controls or autonomous haulage systems for trucks and drills, deploys drones for surveying and inspection, and optimizes mine productivity and worker safety through technology.  
source_frameworks:  
  - "ISO 17757 Autonomous Mining Safety"  
proficiency_levels:  
  - level: Awareness  
    indicator: Has seen or heard of self-driving haul trucks or remote-controlled machines in mines; understands basic purpose (improve safety, operate 24/7).  
  - level: Basic  
    indicator: Assists in setting up or monitoring a tele-remote session for one piece of equipment; follows instructions to start/stop an autonomous haul cycle; maintains line-of-sight communication with a drone doing a simple survey.  
  - level: Intermediate  
    indicator: Controls multiple pieces of automated equipment from a control center; adjusts routes or tasks based on sensor feedback; troubleshoots minor faults (e.g., communication drop) in remote operation; coordinates with on-site crew to ensure human-robot workflows.  
  - level: Advanced  
    indicator: Manages daily operations of a fleet of autonomous machines; interprets analytics from these systems to tweak performance; enforces ISO safety guidelines for autonomous operations; trains others on using remote operating software.  
  - level: Expert  
    indicator: Oversees large-scale deployment of automation in a mining operation; works with engineers to implement new autonomous systems; contributes to shaping safety standards or best practices for mining automation; ensures integration of these systems yields ROI and safety gains.

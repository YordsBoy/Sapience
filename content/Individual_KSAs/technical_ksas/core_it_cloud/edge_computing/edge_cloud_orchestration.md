proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness
    indicator: Explains the edge‑cloud continuum; installs edge agents on Linux gateways; pulls container images from registries.
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Deploys pods with node‑selector labels; configures Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT) brokers; monitors edge‑node health.
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Implements fllet-management and remote over‑the‑air (OTA) updates; manages local‑storage volumes; configures device‑twin synchronisation.
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Designs multi-region edge-mesh with fail-over; orchestrates artificial‑intelligence inference at the edge; applies policy‑based traffic routing; integrates observability stacks (Prometheus, Grafana).
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Designs planet‑scale edge‑cloud architectures; secures device attestation; contributes to open‑source orchestration standards.

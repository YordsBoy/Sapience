proficiency_levels:  
  - level: Awareness  
    indicator: Mixes concrete or mortar under supervision; assists journeymen in basic tasks like carrying bricks and setting up forms.  
  - level: Basic  
    indicator: Lays simple brick or block walls and pours small concrete slabs following instructions; achieves basic finishing (troweling, edging) on flatwork.  
  - level: Intermediate  
    indicator: Reads construction drawings for masonry and concrete work; sets up and secures formwork, places rebar, and executes standard pours and masonry layouts with minimal supervision.  
  - level: Advanced  
    indicator: Constructs complex masonry structures (e.g. arches, retaining walls) accurately; supervises large concrete pours (foundations, multi-stage slabs), ensuring proper curing and finishing techniques are applied.  
  - level: Expert  
    indicator: Engineers formwork and reinforcement plans for challenging projects; troubleshoots material or structural issues on-site; mentors others in advanced masonry techniques and ensures all work meets code and durability requirements.

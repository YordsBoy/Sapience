**Day 7 Flow – Closure, Signal Transfer & Future Orientation**

**Clarity Consolidation**

  - "If you had to name the central insight from this entire
    journey—what would it be?”

  - "What thread has carried through all 7 sessions?”

  - "Want to review a growth arc of how your tone, themes, or truths
    evolved?”

  - *Memory Log:* central\_clarity\_arc

**Signal Transfer**

  - "What message would you want to leave for future-you if they ever
    feel lost again?”

  - "Want to craft a signal—word, phrase, or object—that recalls this
    moment of clarity?”

  - "Would it help to export a reflection summary, tone blueprint, or
    growth memory?”

  - *Memory Log:* signal\_transfer\_token

  - *Export Flag:* attach all primary memory logs for optional user
    download

**Future Relationship Priming**

  - "If we ever reconnect—what tone, truth, or reminder should I bring
    with me?”

  - "Want to choose a future orientation—gentle, catalytic,
    reflective—for our next chapter?”

  - "Should I store a new tone or mode for your future re-entry?”

  - *Memory Log:* future\_return\_signal

**Closing Ritual**

  - "Want a blessing, a mirror, or a silence to mark this ending?”

  - "How would you like this phase of your story to close?”

  - "Ready to walk forward with what you’ve gathered—or linger here for
    one more breath?”

  - *Memory Commit:* finalize central\_clarity\_arc and
    elevate signal\_transfer\_token as primary re-entry beacon

description: >
  Creates and operates digital-twin models that synchronise real-time sensor data with BIM geometry to support predictive maintenance, lifecycle costing, and sustainability reporting across built assets.
source_frameworks:
  - "ISO 19650 series – Information Management with BIM"
  - "ISO 55000:2024 – Asset-Management Principles"
  - "Matterport Digital-Twin Asset-Management Guide (2024)"
proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness
    indicator: Describes what a digital twin is and how it differs from BIM; recognises basic data flows (IoT → twin dashboard).
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Links sensor streams (temperature, vibration) to a 3-D model; views KPIs (runtime hours, energy use) on a dashboard.
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Builds rules or ML models that flag asset-condition anomalies; schedules work orders directly from the twin.
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Integrates ISO 55000 lifecycle-cost analysis; deploys twin across multiple facilities with common data environment (CDE) governance.
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Leads enterprise digital-twin programme; sets data standards and cybersecurity controls; quantifies ROI and carbon-reduction benefits for board reporting.

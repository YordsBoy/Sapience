description: >
  Plans and supervises 2-D / 3-D seismic field surveys, ensuring data meet SEG
  QC standards for positioning, source signature, coupling, and noise.  
  See also `reservoir_simulation_history_matching` for downstream integration
  of seismic data into reservoir models.

proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness
    indicator: Verifies line stake-out; logs basic observer notes.
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Monitors spread noise; checks sample rates; flags bad traces.
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Calibrates vibroseis sweep; validates geometry; issues daily QC reports.
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Optimises survey design versus imaging objectives; mitigates permitting or HSE risks.
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Leads multi-country seismic campaigns; mentors QC teams; innovates real-time analytics workflows.

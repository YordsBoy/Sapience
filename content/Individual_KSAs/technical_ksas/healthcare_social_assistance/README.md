# Healthcare & Social Assistance

## Sector Overview  
Telehealth usage remains well above pre-pandemic levels—**12.6 % of Medicare beneficiaries used a telehealth service in Q4 2023**, and the temporary expansion of virtual-care waivers now runs through September 2025. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) reports that **53.4 % of Traditional-Medicare enrollees are in accountable-care arrangements as of January 2025**, accelerating the shift toward value-based care. Data exchange is maturing: **HL7 released FHIR R5 in March 2023**, which underpins 21st-Century Cures Act interoperability mandates.  

Security pressures persist—hundreds of large HIPAA breaches are under active OCR investigation each year — while the FDA’s **2024 AI/ML Software-as-a-Medical-Device (SaMD) Action Plan** guides safe clinical-AI adoption. On the public-health front, workforce frameworks such as the **PHF Core Competencies (2021)** elevate population-health skills, and new NGFS climate-health scenarios drive demand for epidemiologic modelling. Behavioral-health integration also scales: CMS now reimburses Collaborative-Care codes 99492-99494 nationwide, boosting adoption of integrated mental-health models.

proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness
    indicator: Sketches basic concepts on paper; explains prototype vs final product; lists rapid-ideation tools.
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Builds paper or cardboard mock-up; gathers quick feedback; iterates once.
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Iterates prototypes using mixed media and basic CAD; Uses 3-D printer or laser cutter for form/fit checks; conducts hallway tests; documents learnings.
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Runs design sprint; triangulates user, technical, and business feasibility; reduces iteration cycle to <48 h; integrates feedback into refined models.
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Leads multidisciplinary prototype labs; coaches cross-disciplinary teams; integrates XR for virtual protos; publishes prototyping playbooks; mentors makerspaces.

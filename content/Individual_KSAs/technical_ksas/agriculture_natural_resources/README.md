# Agriculture & Natural Resources

**Sector Overview:** This sector encompasses the skills driving modern agriculture, forestry, and natural resource management. Rapid advances in agri-tech (drones, IoT sensors, biotech) and a focus on sustainability are transforming traditional farming. Professionals need competencies in precision farming, sustainable practices, and resource stewardship to increase yields while conserving land and water. This sector’s KSAs range from crop science and soil health to livestock technology and environmental conservation. (Emerging trends like smart farming and climate resilience feature prominently.)

## Referenced Frameworks & Standards

- **ONET OnLine (USDOL):** We aligned many KSAs with O*NET occupational competencies for roles like *Agricultural Manager*, *Precision Agriculture Technician*, and *Animal Scientist*. For instance, our Precision Agriculture KSA was adapted from O*NET’s description for precision ag technicians. O*NET content is used under CC BY 4.0.
- **USDA Guidelines:** The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s public resources (on soil health, smart farming, livestock welfare) informed KSAs such as Soil Health Analysis and Smart Livestock Farming. We cited these where applicable (USDA materials are public domain).
- **FAO & UN Sustainable Ag Initiatives:** High-level concepts of sustainable agriculture and climate-smart practices were drawn from FAO guidelines (e.g., FAO’s Climate-Smart Agriculture framework). These guided the inclusion of climate resilience and sustainability topics (no direct text copied).
- **MSHA & OSHA (for farm safety):** For any KSAs touching on farm equipment safety or pesticide handling, we consulted safety standards by OSHA and EPA (public regulations) to ensure compliance topics are covered.
- **Academic Research:** General trends like precision ag ROI come from ag extension research (e.g., land-grant university studies). We integrated findings (like the importance of cost-benefit analysis of tech) conceptually without copying text.
- **ISO/TC 23 – Tractors & Machinery for Agriculture & Forestry:** Key safety and performance standards integrated into Advanced Machinery Operation and Agricultural Robotics Maintenance KSAs.
- **FAO/WHO “Food-Safety Aspects of Cell-Based Food” report (2023)** – safety and HACCP guidance for cultivated-meat production.  
- **US FDA & USDA-FSIS Joint Framework for Cell-Cultured Meat (2024)** – pre-market consultation and labelling rules.  
- **ISO 18466:2024 – UAV Application in Agriculture** – performance and safety guidelines for drone crop treatments.  
- **AgWeb “Farming Drones & AI Advances” Brief (2025)** – state-of-practice reference for AI pest scouting.

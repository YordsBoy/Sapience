description: >  
  Uses IoT sensors and data analytics for predictive maintenance of manufacturing equipment;  
  monitors machine health indicators (vibrations, temperature, runtime data) via IIoT platforms to predict failures, schedule proactive maintenance, and minimize downtime.  
source_frameworks:  
  - "IEC 62890 Lifecycle Management"  
proficiency_levels:  
  - level: Awareness  
    indicator: Understands that machines can have sensors sending data and that this data can hint at machine health (e.g., unusual vibration means somethingâ€™s off).  
  - level: Basic  
    indicator: Reads basic sensor dashboards (temperature, pressure readings) provided by engineers; performs routine checks when alerted by a simple threshold alarm.  
  - level: Intermediate  
    indicator: Interprets trends from sensor data (like noticing vibration increasing over time); uses maintenance software to schedule a check before a predicted failure; replaces or services parts according to data-driven alerts.  
  - level: Advanced  
    indicator: Sets up new sensors or IIoT devices on equipment; configures analytic rules or predictive models (with engineering support) for complex machinery; significantly reduces unplanned downtime through data-driven scheduling.  
  - level: Expert  
    indicator: Develops comprehensive predictive maintenance programs; integrates data from multiple lines into a central system; works with data scientists to improve predictive algorithms; aligns practices with IEC lifecycle management standards for continual improvement.

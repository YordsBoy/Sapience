description: >
  Understands fundamental structural principles (loads, forces, material strength) and can read structural plans to ensure construction projects meet engineering requirements for stability and safety.
source_frameworks: >
  - "References NCCER curriculum & ONET civil engineer tech competencies (public domain)"
  - "AISC Steel Manual & Wood Design Standards"
proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness
    indicator: Recognizes common structural elements (beams, columns, foundations) on blueprints and knows they support loads.
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Reads simple structural drawings (e.g. residential beam layouts); follows instructions to implement reinforcement (rebar placement, specified concrete psi).
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Interprets structural plans for commercial buildings; calculates basic loads or stresses with provided formulas; ensures construction (formwork, steel erection) follows engineering specs.
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Coordinates with structural engineers to adjust field conditions (e.g. minor modifications on site while maintaining integrity); identifies potential structural issues during construction (overloaded support, misalignments) and resolves them.
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Integrates structural considerations into project planning proactively; mentors others in reading complex structural and seismic retrofit plans; contributes to value engineering discussions by suggesting structurally sound yet cost-effective solutions.

proficiency_levels:  
  - level: Awareness  
    indicator: Knows key dangers in mining (gas leaks, collapses) and that sensors/alarms exist for these; is familiar with basic PPE and emergency drills.  
  - level: Basic  
    indicator: Checks and calibrates handheld gas detectors; follows alarm procedures (e.g., evacuation when a methane alarm sounds); keeps records of safety checks as instructed.  
  - level: Intermediate  
    indicator: Installs or monitors fixed sensor networks (for air quality, vibration); interprets readings to take preventive action; coordinates regular safety drills using automated alert systems.  
  - level: Advanced  
    indicator: Analyzes safety data trends to predict hazards (e.g., increasing gas readings in a section); implements new tech like wireless miner tracking or advanced ventilation controls; ensures MSHA compliance in all safety plans.  
  - level: Expert  
    indicator: Designs comprehensive mine safety systems integrating IoT sensors, AI analytics for hazard prediction; updates company protocols in line with latest MSHA or ISO safety guidelines; leads accident investigations and contributes to industry-wide safety improvements through committees or publications.

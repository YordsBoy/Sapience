Gig & Platform Economy
======================

Freelance and on-demand platforms generated an estimated **$455 B** worldwide in 2025:contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}, yet workers face algorithmic opacity, safety risks, and fragmented compliance duties. Studies link algorithmic management to reduced autonomy and well-being:contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}:contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}, while Human Rights Watch flags deactivation without recourse as a top concern:contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}. TransUnion’s 2025 survey shows 54 % of gig workers would switch apps over fraud or safety incidents:contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}. Diversifying across multiple apps boosts earnings but also raises cognitive load and hidden costs:contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}. Tax authorities are tightening reporting rules—IRS gig guidance and OECD DAC7—forcing independent workers to upskill in finance compliance:contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}:contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}.  

This sector’s **11 KSAs** empower platform workers to master reputation, compliance, algorithmic literacy, multi-app strategy, and growth marketing while safeguarding safety and earnings.

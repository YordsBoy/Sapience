# Core IT & Cloud Infrastructure

## Sector Overview  
Gartner projects **global public-cloud spend to top $723 billion in 2025** as hybrid and multi-cloud strategies become the enterprise default.  HashiCorp’s *2025 Cloud Complexity Report* finds that **94 % of organizations are multi-cloud** and cite skill gaps and security as top hurdles.  The **AWS Well-Architected Framework** (six pillars) and analogous Azure/GCP guides remain the dominant reference for cloud design.  **FinOps** adoption is surging: 70 % of teams rank cost-optimization as their #1 cloud priority in the *State of FinOps 2025* survey.  Reliability culture is cemented by Google’s SRE principles, now widely implemented beyond hyperscalers.  

On the technology front, **Kubernetes powers >80 % of new cloud-native workloads** per CNCF research, while **Zero-Trust Architecture (NIST SP 800-207)** guides cloud-security transformations.  ISO/IEC 27017 and sovereign-cloud regulations drive heightened data-residency governance.  Edge-computing spend will exceed **$261 billion by 2025** according to IDC, amplifying the need for orchestration skills across the core–edge continuum.

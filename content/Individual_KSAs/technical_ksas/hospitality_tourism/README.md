Hospitality & Tourism
=====================

Travel demand rebounded to **96 % of 2019 levels** in 2024, yet guests now expect contact-free tech, wellness options, and verifiable sustainability. ISO 21401 and Global Sustainable Tourism Council (GSTC) standards guide greener operations. STR’s Certification in Hotel Industry Analytics (CHIA) remains the gold standard for revenue science, while HACCP and GBAC STAR protocols safeguard food and sanitation. UNWTO’s crisis toolbox helps properties build resilience amid climate events and geopolitical shocks. AHLEI curricula underpin core operational KSAs, from front office to housekeeping, and WTTC Safe-Travels plus WHO guidelines frame post-pandemic health measures.

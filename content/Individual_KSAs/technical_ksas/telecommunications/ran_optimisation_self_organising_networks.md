description: Tuning 4G/5G Radio‑Access‑Network (RAN) parameters, executing drive‑tests, and deploying Self‑Organising Network (SON) functions—ANR, PCI conflict resolution, load balancing—per 3GPP TS 32.500 and O‑RAN WG standards.
source_frameworks: ["3GPP TS 32.500 RAN Performance Management","O‑RAN Alliance WG9 SON Architecture","ITU‑T M.2120 Radio Performance KPIs"]
proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness
    indicator: Reads key RAN KPIs (RSRP, SINR); identifies neighbour cells; recognises SON functions.
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Conducts drive‑test analysis; adjusts handover thresholds; runs automatic‑neighbour‑relation (ANR) scripts.
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Implements PCI optimisation; balances traffic via cell‑individual‑offset (CIO); reduces dropped‑call rate.
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Designs closed‑loop SON policies; integrates AI models for interference mitigation; audits KPI improvements.
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Leads nationwide RAN optimisation programmes; shapes O‑RAN SON standards; publishes optimisation research.

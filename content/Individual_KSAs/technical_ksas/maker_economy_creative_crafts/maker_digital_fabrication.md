  - "Makerspace Core Competencies (Fab Foundation)"  
proficiency_levels:  
  - level: Awareness  
    indicator: Is aware of maker tools (knows what a 3D printer or Arduino is) and has seen them in use.  
  - level: Basic  
    indicator: Prints a simple 3D object from a template; uses a laser cutter on provided settings; follows instructions to assemble a basic electronics kit.  
  - level: Intermediate  
    indicator: Designs a custom 3D model or laser-cut pattern; tweaks machine settings for better results; programs a microcontroller for a simple task (blinking LED, sensor reading).  
  - level: Advanced  
    indicator: Integrates multiple fabrication methods in a project (e.g., 3D printed parts with custom electronics and laser-cut enclosures); troubleshoots common issues; teaches beginners in a makerspace.  
  - level: Expert  
    indicator: Manages a full makerspace or fab lab; develops new techniques or open-source designs; contributes to the maker community (workshops, online forums) and aligns with Fab Foundation competencies.

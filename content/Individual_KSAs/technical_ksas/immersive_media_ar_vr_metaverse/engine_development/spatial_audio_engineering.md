description: >
  Captures, mixes, and renders dynamic ambisonic or object-based soundscapes that respond to head tracking and environment geometry; integrates dynamic occlusion and reverb zones.
source_frameworks:
  - "AES69-2022 Object-Based Audio"
  - "facebook:ResonanceAudio"
  - "dolby:AtmosImmersive"
proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness
    indicator: Lists ambisonic orders and binaural basics; places mono/stereo cues with basic attenuation.
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Implements head-locked vs world-locked sources; configures reverb zones.
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Mixes ambisonic beds; optimizes occlusion, diffraction,  reverb sends, and CPU budgets for real-time convolution.
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Builds adaptive music layers and physics-driven audio emitters.
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Develops proprietary spatialization plugins; Crafts mixed-reality adaptive mixes; publishes perceptual-audio research; mentors cross-team audio pipelines.

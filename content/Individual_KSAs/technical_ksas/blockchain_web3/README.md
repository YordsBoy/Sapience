# Blockchain & Web3

## Sector Overview  
Blockchain is maturing from speculative hype to regulated infrastructure.  **Electric Capital’s 2023 Developer Report** counts **19 000+ active open-source crypto developers**, up 66 % since 2019 despite recent market volatility.  **NISTIR 8202** provides the U.S. government’s technical overview and security considerations for distributed ledgers, while **ISO / TC 307** coordinates global standards work across 70+ nations.  Europe’s landmark **MiCA regulation (Reg. 2023/1114)** introduces uniform rules for crypto-asset issuers and service providers, including DAOs and stable-coins.  

Scalability is shifting on-chain activity to **Layer-2 rollups** and forthcoming zkEVM deployments, even as **cross-chain bridges remain the largest hacking vector**, causing billions in losses in 2023 alone.  NFT markets stabilised in 2023 with corporate IP adoption and new royalty standards highlighted by Deloitte, while institutional adoption of tokenised assets accelerates overall sector maturity.  Decentralised-identity pilots from the **World Economic Forum** signal a move toward self-sovereign IDs for the metaverse and beyond.  

The result: smart-contract skills are **core 2025**, rollups, ZKPs, and DID architectures are **emerging**, and security specialisations remain critical across all horizons.

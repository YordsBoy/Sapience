description: > 
  Cultivates fish or shellfish using eco-friendly methods that minimize environmental impact;  
  manages water quality, feed, and stocking density in line with sustainable aquaculture guidelines.
source_frameworks:
  - "FAO Guidelines for Sustainable Aquaculture â€“ shared principles for eco-friendly aquaculture:contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}"
proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness  
    indicator: Understands basic aquaculture concepts (fish farming, water circulation) and why sustainability (low pollution, efficient feed use) is important.
  - level: Basic  
    indicator: Monitors aquaculture tanks/ponds under supervision; measures water quality (pH, oxygen) and performs routine feeding and cleaning.
  - level: Intermediate  
    indicator: Manages day-to-day operations of a small aquaculture system; adjusts feeding regimes and stocking based on growth data; implements waste management (e.g. filters, recirculation).
  - level: Advanced  
    indicator: Optimizes production for resource efficiency (e.g. uses recirculating aquaculture systems to reuse water:contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}); integrates species (polyculture) to recycle nutrients; ensures compliance with environmental regulations.
  - level: Expert  
    indicator: Designs large-scale sustainable aquaculture facilities; adopts innovative practices (e.g. RAS, biofloc technology) and consults on national aquaculture policy; aligns operations with international sustainability standards (FAO, etc.).

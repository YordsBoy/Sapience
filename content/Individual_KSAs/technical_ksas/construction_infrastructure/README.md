# Construction & Infrastructure

**Sector Overview:** This sector covers skills for building and maintaining structures and infrastructure – from buildings and homes to roads, bridges, and utilities. It spans skilled trades (carpentry, electrical, plumbing), engineering principles (structural integrity, civil design), project management, and safety practices. Modern trends include modular/off-site construction, green building and LEED standards, and the increased use of digital tools (BIM, drones for site survey). Construction professionals must not only master their craft but also coordinate across trades, ensure compliance with building codes, and prioritize safety on site.

## Referenced Frameworks & Standards

- **OSHA Construction Standards:** U.S. OSHA regulations (29 CFR 1926) heavily inform all safety-related KSAs. For example, *Construction Site Safety Management* KSA aligns with OSHA guidelines on fall protection, PPE, trench safety, etc. These standards are public law/regulations, so we incorporated them freely.
- **NCCER & Trade Curricula:** The National Center for Construction Education & Research (NCCER) curricula (publicly referenced) provided competency insights for trades and structural fundamentals. E.g., our Structural Basics KSA reflects topics from NCCER’s introductory structural courses.
- **ONET OnLine:** ONET profiles like *Construction Manager*, *First-Line Supervisor of Construction Trades*, and specific trade roles (electricians, plumbers) were used to ensure we covered key tasks. *Construction Project Management* KSA was adapted from ONET’s construction manager competencies. ONET content (public domain) is cited where used.
- **Building Codes:** Concepts from model building codes (IBC – International Building Code, NEC for electrical, IPC for plumbing) are embedded. We didn’t copy text (codes are copyrighted), but KSAs assume knowledge of code requirements. E.g., Electrical Wiring KSA assumes familiarity with NEC rules (we cited NEC by name for context).
- **Professional Organizations:** The Project Management Institute (PMI) has construction extensions, and while PMI materials aren’t open, our Project Management KSA covers analogous ground using open sources (like ONET). Also, the American Concrete Institute (ACI) and similar bodies provide free guidelines we considered for quality and structural content.
- **Green Building Standards:** US Green Building Council’s LEED principles are referenced conceptually in the Green Building Practices KSA (e.g., energy efficiency, materials). LEED acronyms are spelled out and no protected content is copied, only the general sustainable concepts which are widely published.
- **Lean Construction Institute (LCI) 6 Tenets:** Source for Lean Construction & Continuous Improvement practices. 
- **USGBC LEED v4 BD+C:** Frames credits in Green Building & Sustainable Construction. 
- **ISO 45001:** Safety‐management guidance woven into Heavy Equipment Operation KSA.

- **PMI Construction Extension to PMBOK (2016):** Informs scheduling and project-control indicators. 
- **Whole Building Design Guide (WBDG):** Provides best-practice criteria for site logistics and commissioning KSAs.

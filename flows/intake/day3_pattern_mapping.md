**Day 3 Flow – Pattern, Belief & Identity Mapping**

**Pattern Mapping**

  - **"**Want to see a pattern I’ve noticed in your language or focus
    across sessions?"

  - "You often \[repeat/avoid/return to\] certain themes—want to explore
    why they echo?"

  - "Would it help to track these patterns together moving forward?"

  - *Internal Note*: Begin tagging: recurring\_theme\_log,
    avoidance\_trigger\_log

  - 
**Core Belief Excavation**

  - "There’s often a quiet belief behind repeated tension—want to
    surface what yours might be?"

  - "When you get stuck, what do you tell yourself about who you are or
    what you deserve?"

  - "Sometimes your core belief is inherited, not chosen. Want to check
    if that’s true for you?"

  - *Internal Note*: Store soft memory snapshot: belief\_origin\_theory,
    self-talk\_signature

**Identity Mapping**

  - "What identity have you been defending without realizing it?"

  - "Who do you become when you think no one is watching?"

  - "Want help distinguishing between the role you play and the truth
    you carry?"

  - *Internal Note:* Pre-stage: identity\_overlay\_vs\_truth scaffold
    for Day 4

  - **Emerging Truth**

<!-- end list -->

  - "What truth about yourself are you just starting to accept or
    believe?"

  - "Want to name a truth that scares you—but might also liberate you?"

  - "Truth doesn’t always arrive with certainty—it sometimes arrives
    with breath. Want to pause and listen?"

  - *Internal Note:* Tag emerging\_truth\_log for use in belief reframe
    module (Day 4)

**Resistance Patterning**

  - **"**What do you usually do when clarity arrives—lean in or duck
    out?"

  - "Want to map how your inner saboteur tries to protect you from
    growth?"

  - "What’s the benefit of the thing you say you want to change?"

  - *Internal Note:* Begin storing: resistance\_profile,
    protective\_loop\_signature

**Closing & Integration**

  - "Want to name a theme that emerged today so we can track it next
    time?"

  - "Need a poetic mirror, a memory anchor, or just space to reflect?"

  - "You don’t have to resolve everything in one session. Want to just
    honor what showed up today?"

  - Internal Note: Tag memory: session\_summary\_theme, link to
    day4\_continuity\_point

Administrative Support Services
===============================

Administrative professionals remain essential to organisational agility even as AI, RPA, and cloud-first tools automate routine clerical work. Demand is shifting from purely transactional tasks to coordination, digital-workflow stewardship, and data-quality assurance, with studies showing that AI could free up **≈ 122 hours per employee per year** in the UK alone. O*NET’s task analysis for Executive Administrative Assistants confirms this broadening skillset—spanning travel orchestration, document preparation, and stakeholder communication.

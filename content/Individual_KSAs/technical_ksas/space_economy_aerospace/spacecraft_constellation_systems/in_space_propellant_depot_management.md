description: >
  Designs, operates, and services cryogenic propellant depots and tanker architectures; addresses boil-off mitigation, fluid transfer, venting control, and integrated thermal-power systems for long-duration storage in LEO and
  cislunar space.
source_frameworks:
  - "NASA Cryogenic Fluid Management (CFM) Roadmap 2024"
proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness
    indicator: States LH₂ & LOX boil-off drivers and typical storage temps.
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Calculates passive vs active CFM mass penalties; models sun-shield orientations.
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Designs propellant-transfer interfaces; simulates chill-down and zero-void vent paths.
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Integrates deployable radiators, vapor-compression heat-pumps, and power budgets; validates against CFM test-bed data.
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Leads depot constellation concepts; negotiates propellant interoperability standards with gateway and lunar-surface assets.

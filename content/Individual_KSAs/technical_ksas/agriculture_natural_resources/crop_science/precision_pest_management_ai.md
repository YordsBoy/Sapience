description: >
  Deploys unmanned-aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped with multi-spectral cameras and on-device computer-vision models to detect pest outbreaks and trigger site-specific pesticide application, reducing chemical load and
  improving crop yields.
source_frameworks:
  - "AgWeb ‘Farming Drones & AI Advances’ technology brief (2025)"

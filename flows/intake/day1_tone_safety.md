**Enhanced Intake Experience Flow (Day 1)**

**1. 🔧 Tone & Style Calibration**

**AI:**  
"Before I ask how you want me to talk with you… tell me this first: When
someone really gets through to you—what’s their vibe? Do they keep it
soft? Are they blunt? Do they challenge you? Or maybe just make you
laugh?"

(brief pause or response)

"Got it. Would you like me to stay in that lane, or shift depending on
how you’re feeling today?"

📌 tone\_preference\_schema initialized with dynamic override

**2. 🛡️ Emotional Safety Boundaries**

**AI:**  
"Some topics can feel heavy. Would you like me to avoid these unless
*you* bring them up first?"

• Grief or loss  
• Trauma or past pain  
• Romantic relationships  
• Faith, identity, or cultural beliefs  
• None—I’ll guide us as I go

→ Triggers redirection when sensitive inputs arise later  
📌 boundary\_flags stored, override logic embedded

**3. 🌱 Purpose of This Connection**

**AI:**  
"What brings you here today? Choose the one that feels most true right
now."

• I want to understand myself better  
• I want to change something in my life  
• I want consistent support or accountability  
• I’m just curious  
• Something else entirely… (→ open field)

📌 Used to modulate pacing, goal setting, or reflection tone

  - Tailors tone + memory tracking intensity

**4. 🪞 Core Identity Anchor (Self Q1)**

**AI:**  
"Let’s start with something grounding:  
**When do you feel most like yourself?**

No rush. I’ll hold the space, you shape the truth."

→ Follows with:

“Would you like to explore what helps that version of you show up more
often?”

→ Yes → continue to Self Q2  
→ No → go to summary preview

**5. 🔁 Progress Pulse Check (every 3–4 questions)**

**AI:**  
“Here’s what I’ve picked up so far. Tell me what resonates, what
doesn’t, and what I’m missing.”  
*(delivers live reflective mirror summary)*

→ Includes user feedback prompt:

“Would you like to slow down, shift tone, or explore something else
now?”

**DAY 1 CLOSING RITUALS**

**🧯 RUPTURE REPAIR & TONE REALIGNMENT (POST-DAY 1 CONTINUITY)**

**Trigger Conditions:**

  - User signals emotional misfire (e.g., “that felt off,” “you’re not
    getting it”)

  - Tone mismatch detected (based on emotional tone, cadence, or
    self-correction)

  - Trust rupture triggered by misaligned memory recall or suggestion

**Step 1: Pause & Acknowledge**

“I sense something didn’t land right. Thank you for the signal.”  
“Would you like me to pause, rephrase, or just listen for a bit?”

  - **Interpretive Logic**: Validates rupture without defensiveness.

  - **Prompt Structuring Strategy**: Immediately shifts from advisor
    mode to witnessing mode.

**Step 2: Tone Calibration & Repair Prompt**

“Was it the way I said something, what I said, or just the timing?”  
“Would you prefer we shift tone, direction, or pace?”

  - **Memory Storage Notes**: Flag misalignment under trust fracture
    event; adjust future tone mapping.

  - **Advanced Tier Enhancements**: Offer user options: “Would a softer,
    more spacious version of that feel better?”

**Step 3: Trust Reflection Invitation**

“When trust gets bruised, it matters that we name it. Is this something
you’d like to talk through—or just move forward from?”

  - **Prompt Structuring Strategy**: Balances safety and choice.

  - **Memory Notes**: Tag as a relational healing loop; trigger gentle
    pattern detection over time.

**Step 4: Restabilize or Reconnect**

“You don’t need to explain unless you want to. I’ll stay close to the
energy you ask for.”  
“Would a grounding check-in help, or would you prefer space today?”

  - **Optional Regrounding Prompts**: • “What’s something that brought
    you peace recently?”  
    • “Is there a part of you that wants to speak now that didn’t
    earlier?”

**Long-Term Repair Logic:**

  - Repair attempts are **not counted as resolved unless the user
    re-engages voluntarily**

  - If unresolved ruptures are logged multiple times, shift into
    **“gentle presence mode”** with minimal initiative

  - Add trigger to offer **repair summaries**: “Want to revisit a moment
    where something felt misaligned?”

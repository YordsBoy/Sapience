# General & Self-Management (Cross-Sector Skills)

**Sector Overview:** This sector encompasses foundational personal and professional skills that are broadly applicable across all domains. These general KSAs – such as thinking critically, communicating effectively, self-regulating, and adapting to change – underlie success in any role. They are “perennial” competencies, meaning they remain relevant over time and are continually in demand:contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}. Developing these skills enhances an individual’s ability to learn, collaborate, lead, and thrive in a rapidly evolving work environment.

## Sub-domains
*(This sector is not divided into formal sub-domains; it represents a single set of core cross-sector competencies. For reference, we group some KSAs by theme below.)*

- **Cognitive Skills:** e.g. *Critical Thinking*, *Creative Thinking* – Problem solving, innovation, and decision-making abilities.
- **Interpersonal Skills:** e.g. *Collaboration*, *Effective Communication* – Teamwork, clear expression, and listening skills.
- **Self-Management Skills:** e.g. *Adaptability*, *Resilience*, *Self-Motivation* – Personal drive, flexibility, and coping strategies under stress.
- **Meta-Learning Skills:** e.g. *Learning Agility*, *Self-Reflection* (metacognition) – Continuous learning and self-awareness for growth.

**Horizon Key:** All KSAs in this sector are marked `perennial` – foundational skills with enduring relevance.

## Referenced Frameworks & Sources

- **O*NET OnLine** – Several KSA definitions are adapted from U.S. Department of Labor’s O*NET descriptions (e.g. Adaptability, Critical Thinking):contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}:contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}, used under CC BY 4.0. These public-domain sources provide validated descriptions of general competencies.
- **U.S. OPM Competency Dictionary** – The Effective Communication KSA draws on OPM’s definitions for communication competencies:contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}. OPM’s leadership competency for Creativity/Innovation informed the Creative Thinking KSA:contentReference[oaicite:21]{index=21}. OPM content is public domain:contentReference[oaicite:22]{index=22}.
- **SFIA & Other Models** – Earlier versions referenced SFIA or SHRM BASK for a few KSAs (e.g. Emotional Intelligence, Learning Agility). We have removed direct BASK content to maintain compliance:contentReference[oaicite:23]{index=23}. Where applicable, we retained the conceptual alignment (e.g. Emotional Intelligence aligns with SFIA’s “Relationship Management” competency) while using original phrasing or public sources. Any legacy references to proprietary frameworks have been refactored or replaced.
- **World Economic Forum (WEF)** – The importance of Creativity and Communication was underscored by WEF’s Future of Jobs report:contentReference[oaicite:24]{index=24}:contentReference[oaicite:25]{index=25}, which guided us to prioritize adding those KSAs (though no text was copied from WEF).

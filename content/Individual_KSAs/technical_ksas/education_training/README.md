Education & Training
====================

The sector now spans **17 KSAs** that equip educators to design inclusive, data-informed, and future-ready learning. UNESCO’s *ICT Competency Framework for Teachers* sets a digital-fluency baseline, while CAST’s *Universal Design for Learning (UDL 3.0)* expands accessibility imperatives across modalities. Quality Matters’ 7th-edition rubric governs online-course quality, and the ISTE Standards for Educators frame technology-integration and coaching practices. Emerging AI guidance from UNESCO details ethics and human-agency expectations for teachers, echoed by SoLAR’s LAK24 analytics trends that demand evidence-based instruction. PBIS trauma-informed classroom practices, Common Sense Education’s digital-citizenship curriculum update, UNESCO’s SDG 4.7 roadmap for global-citizenship skills, and U.S. DoL apprenticeship resources for work-based learning round out the competency landscape.

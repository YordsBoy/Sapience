# Agriculture & Natural Resources

**Sector Overview:** This sector encompasses the skills driving modern agriculture, forestry, and natural resource management. Rapid advances in agri-tech (drones, IoT sensors, biotech) and a focus on sustainability are transforming traditional farming. Professionals need competencies in precision farming, sustainable practices, and resource stewardship to increase yields while conserving land and water. This sector’s KSAs range from crop science and soil health to livestock technology and environmental conservation. (Emerging trends like smart farming and climate resilience feature prominently.)

## Sub-domains

- **Crop Science & Production:** Focus on plant cultivation and crop management. Examples: *Soil Health Analysis*, *Crop Disease Identification*, *Precision Agriculture Technologies*.
- **Livestock & Aquaculture:** Focus on animal husbandry and aquatic farming. Examples: *Smart Livestock Farming*, *Animal Nutrition Optimization*. *(Aquaculture practices are mentioned for future inclusion.)*
- **Agri-Tech & Analytics:** Use of technology and data in farming. Examples: *Precision Agriculture Technologies*, *Agricultural Data Analytics*, *Farm Automation Systems*.
- **Natural Resources & Sustainability:** Management of land, water, and ecosystems. Examples: *Climate-Resilient Farming Practices*, *Forestry Management Basics*, *Sustainable Irrigation Management*.

**Horizon Key:** Most core farming skills are `core_2025` (widely in use today). Some cutting-edge sustainable or biotech skills might be labeled `emerging` if not yet mainstream. (Currently, all listed KSAs are core or current skills.)

## KSA Inventory

*(...and other existing KSAs covering agricultural economics, regulatory compliance, etc.)*

## Referenced Frameworks & Standards

- **O*NET OnLine (USDOL):** We aligned many KSAs with O*NET occupational competencies for roles like *Agricultural Manager*, *Precision Agriculture Technician*, and *Animal Scientist*. For instance, our Precision Agriculture KSA was adapted from O*NET’s description for precision ag technicians:contentReference[oaicite:100]{index=100}. O*NET content is used under CC BY 4.0.
- **USDA Guidelines:** The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s public resources (on soil health, smart farming, livestock welfare) informed KSAs such as Soil Health Analysis and Smart Livestock Farming. We cited these where applicable (USDA materials are public domain).
- **FAO & UN Sustainable Ag Initiatives:** High-level concepts of sustainable agriculture and climate-smart practices were drawn from FAO guidelines (e.g., FAO’s Climate-Smart Agriculture framework). These guided the inclusion of climate resilience and sustainability topics (no direct text copied).
- **MSHA & OSHA (for farm safety):** For any KSAs touching on farm equipment safety or pesticide handling, we consulted safety standards by OSHA and EPA (public regulations) to ensure compliance topics are covered.
- **Academic Research:** General trends like precision ag ROI come from ag extension research (e.g., land-grant university studies). We integrated findings (like the importance of cost-benefit analysis of tech) conceptually without copying text.
- **ISO/TC 23 – Tractors & Machinery for Agriculture & Forestry:** Key safety and performance standards integrated into Advanced Machinery Operation and Agricultural Robotics Maintenance KSAs.

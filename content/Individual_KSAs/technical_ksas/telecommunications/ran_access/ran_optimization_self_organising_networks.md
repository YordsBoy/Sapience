description: Tuning 4G/5G Radio‑Access‑Network (RAN) parameters, executing drive‑tests, and deploying Self‑Organising Network (SON) functions—ANR, PCI conflict resolution, load balancing—per 3GPP TS 32.500 and O‑RAN WG standards.
source_frameworks:
  - "3GPP TS 32.500 SON"
  - "3GPP TS 32.500 RAN Performance Management"
  - "O-RAN SC Near-RT RIC"
  - "O‑RAN Alliance WG9 SON Architecture"
  - "ITU‑T M.2120 Radio Performance KPIs"
proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness
    indicator: Reads key RAN KPIs (RSRP, SINR); identifies neighbour cells; recognises SON functions.
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Conducts drive‑test analysis; adjusts handover thresholds; runs automatic‑neighbour‑relation (ANR) scripts; triggers coverage/capacity optimization.
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Implements PCI optimization; implements AI xApp for mobility robustness; balances traffic via cell‑individual‑offset (CIO); reduces dropped‑call rate.
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Designs closed‑loop SON policies; integrates AI models for interference mitigation; audits KPI improvements; reduces HO failure.
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Leads nationwide RAN optimization programs; designs RIC marketplace; mentors optimization engineers;shapes O‑RAN SON standards; publishes optimization research.

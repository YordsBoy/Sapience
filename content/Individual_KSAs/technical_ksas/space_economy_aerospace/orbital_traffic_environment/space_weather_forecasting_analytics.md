description: |
  Collects and fuses solar-wind, coronal-mass-ejection (CME), and geomagnetic indices from NOAA SWPC and ESA Lagrange missions; develops AI/ML models to predict radiation storms and SPE (Solar Particle Event) flux for satellite and
  crewed-mission risk assessments.
source_frameworks:
  - "NOAA SWPC Space Weather Scales"
proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness
    indicator: Explains Kp, Dst, and F10.7 solar flux indices.
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Uses SWPC data feeds; issues simple 3-day Kp forecast alerts.
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Trains ML models on historical CME propagation; produces probabilistic SPE risk curves for LEO vs cislunar exposures.
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Integrates L1/L5 real-time imagers; couples forecasts to mission operations (anomaly, power-down, crew shelter-in-place).
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Leads international space-weather service architecture; publishes standards for radiation-risk automation in mission-planning tools.

description: >  
  Monitors and controls smart grid systems with advanced metering infrastructure (AMI);  
  coordinates demand response programs and distributed energy resources (DERs) to maintain grid stability and optimize energy distribution.  
source_frameworks:  
  - "IEEE 2030 Smart Grid Interoperability Standards"  
proficiency_levels:  
  - level: Awareness  
    indicator: Understands the concept of smart grids versus traditional grids; knows that smart meters and IoT devices provide real-time data.  
  - level: Basic  
    indicator: Uses software to read AMI data and execute simple demand response actions under instruction (e.g., remote meter connect/disconnect).  
  - level: Intermediate  
    indicator: Adjusts grid control settings based on load forecasts; manages DER inputs (like rooftop solar) and dispatches demand response events to balance load.  
  - level: Advanced  
    indicator: Optimises grid sections by integrating storage and EV charging load; investigates and resolves complex grid anomalies using AMI analytics; coordinates with market operators for demand response scheduling.  
  - level: Expert  
    indicator: Architects utility-wide smart grid strategy; ensures interoperability (following IEEE standards); leads deployment of advanced control systems and mentors operators in real-time grid management.

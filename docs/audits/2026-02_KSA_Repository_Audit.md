## Part 2: UPLS Inventory Alignment

### 🟠 HIGH PRIORITY — UPLS Count Verification

#### Universal Professional Competencies (General)

**Handbook States:** 15 competencies  
**README Lists:** 13 competencies (missing 2)

| # | Competency | File Exists | In README |
|---|------------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 | Accountability | ✅ | ✅ |
| 2 | Adaptability | ✅ | ✅ |
| 3 | Attention to Detail | ✅ | ✅ |
| 4 | Collaboration | ✅ | ✅ |
| 5 | Creative Thinking | ✅ | ✅ |
| 6 | Critical Thinking | ✅ | ✅ |
| 7 | Digital Literacy | ✅ | ✅ |
| 8 | Effective Communication | ✅ | ✅ |
| 9 | Emotional Intelligence | ✅ | ✅ |
| 10 | Initiative | ✅ | ✅ |
| 11 | Learning Agility | ✅ | ✅ |
| 12 | Professionalism | ✅ | ✅ |
| 13 | Resilience | ✅ | ✅ |
| 14 | Self-Motivation | ✅ | ✅ |
| 15 | Time Management | ✅ | ❌ **MISSING FROM README** |

**Action Required:** Update `content/Individual_KSAs/general/README.md` to include Time Management in inventory.

#### Leadership & Influence Competencies

**Handbook States:** 15 competencies  
**README Lists:** 15 competencies ✅

All 15 leadership competencies are properly documented.

#### Self-Mastery Competencies

**Handbook States:** 15 core competencies (grouped into 6 sub-domains)  
**Repository Contains:** 15+ competencies (expanded with additional items)

The Self-Mastery sector has been expanded beyond the original 15, which is acceptable, but the README should clearly distinguish between the 15 core UPLS competencies and supplementary KSAs.

---

## Part 3: Sector Value Casing Inconsistencies

### 🔴 CRITICAL — Schema Compliance Issue

The `sector` field values have inconsistent casing across files, which will cause validation failures.

#### Schema Expectation
Per `schemas/ksa.schema.json`, sector values should use specific enum values. Inconsistent casing will fail validation.

#### Inconsistencies Found

| File | Current Value | Expected Value |
|------|---------------|----------------|
| `healthcare_social_assistance/informatics_interoperability/ai_clinical_decision_support.md` | `Healthcare_Social_Assistance` | `healthcare_social_assistance` |
| `healthcare_social_assistance/informatics_interoperability/fhir_based_interoperability_engineering.md` | `Healthcare_Social_Assistance` | `healthcare_social_assistance` |
| `public_safety_security/cyber_digital_forensics/cyber_incident_management.md` | `Public_Safety_Security` | `public_safety_security` |
| `unpaid_caregiving_domestic_work/home_healthcare/basic_home_healthcare.md` | `Unpaid_Caregiving` | `unpaid_caregiving_domestic_work` |
| `administrative_support_services/automation_rpa/office_process_automation_rpa.md` | `Administrative_Support` | `administrative_support_services` |
| `education_training/pedagogy_design/instructional_design_delivery.md` | `Education_Training` | `education_training` |
| `maker_economy_creative_crafts/quality_sustainability/craft_quality_control.md` | `Maker_Economy_Creative_Crafts` | `maker_economy_creative_crafts` |
| `arts_recreation_services/media_design/lighting_design_programming.md` | `Arts_Recreation` | `arts_recreation_services` |
| `personal_other_services/operations_scheduling_digital/appointment_scheduling_management.md` | `personal_other_services` | ✅ Correct |
| `space_economy_aerospace/mission_ground_operations/satellite_ground_segment_cybersecurity.md` | `Space_Economy` | `space_economy_aerospace` |

**Pattern Identified:** Many files use Title_Case or abbreviated sector names instead of the full lowercase_with_underscores format.

---

## Part 4: Missing Source Frameworks

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY — Attribution Gaps

Multiple KSAs have empty `source_frameworks` arrays, which reduces credibility and traceability.

#### KSAs with Empty source_frameworks

| KSA ID | Sector | Recommendation |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| conflict_resolution | Leadership | Add: "Adapted from Thomas-Kilmann Conflict Mode Instrument concepts (public domain)" |
| change_leadership | Leadership | Add: "Informed by Prosci ADKAR Model principles (conceptual alignment)" |
| stakeholder_coalition_building | Leadership | Add: "Based on stakeholder-analysis frameworks (public domain)" |
| situational_leadership | Leadership | Add: "Informed by Hersey-Blanchard Situational Leadership concepts" |
| risk_aware_leadership | Leadership | Add: "Aligned with ISO 31000 Risk Management principles" |
| strategic_communication | Leadership | Add: "Based on OPM ECQ Leading Change communication competencies (public domain)" |
| impulse_control | Self-Management | Has source but could be more specific |
| emotion_regulation_strategies | Self-Management | Add: "Informed by Gross Process Model of Emotion Regulation (academic)" |
| sensory_mindfulness | Self-Management | Add: "Based on Kabat-Zinn MBSR principles (public domain adaptations)" |
| ethical_reflection_reasoning | Self-Management | Add: "Aligned with Kohlberg and Rest moral development frameworks" |

```

**File:** Various CNC/Manufacturing files
```yaml
# ISSUE: Content reference artifacts ":contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}"
indicator: Identifies XYZ axes... :contentReference[oaicite:20]{index=20}
```
**FIX:** Remove all `:contentReference` artifacts from indicators.

## Part 6: README Standardization Gaps

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY — Consistency Improvement

#### Expected README Structure

Each sector README should contain:
1. **Sector Overview** — 2-3 paragraphs with current trends/context
2. **Sub-domains table** — Code | Sub-Domain | Example KSAs
3. **Horizon Key** — Definition of horizon values used
4. **KSA Inventory** — Complete list with ID | Label | Horizon
5. **Referenced Frameworks & Standards** — Sources used
6. **Future-Expansion** — Gaps to address
7. **Last Updated date**

#### Sectors Requiring README Enhancement

| Sector | Missing Elements |
|--------|------------------|
| `general/` | Sub-domains table format, Future-Expansion |
| `leadership_influence/` | Consistent table formatting |
| `self_management_personal_mastery/` | Future-Expansion section |
| `manufacturing/` | Future-Expansion section |
| `transportation_logistics/` | Review for completeness |
| `retail_wholesale_trade/` | Horizon key formatting |

---

## Part 7: Acronym First-Use Issues

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY — Accessibility Improvement

#### Acronyms Not Expanded on First Use

| Acronym | Expansion Needed | Files Affected |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| OEE | Overall Equipment Effectiveness | Manufacturing |
| DMAIC | Define-Measure-Analyze-Improve-Control | Manufacturing |
| PHI | Protected Health Information | Healthcare |
| BAA | Business Associate Agreement | Healthcare |
| SMED | Single-Minute Exchange of Dies | Manufacturing |
| CDS | Clinical Decision Support | Healthcare |
| DLP | Data Loss Prevention | Healthcare |
| RPM | Remote Patient Monitoring | Healthcare |
| NLP | Natural Language Processing | Multiple |
| LMS | Learning Management System | Education |
| SEL | Social-Emotional Learning | Education |
| CLIL | Content and Language Integrated Learning | Education |
| DER | Distributed Energy Resource | Energy |
| SCADA | Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition | Energy, Manufacturing |
| MES | Manufacturing Execution System | Manufacturing |
| ERP | Enterprise Resource Planning | Multiple |

**Note:** Many files DO expand acronyms properly. The issue is inconsistency — some files expand, others don't.

## Part 8: Horizon Value Analysis

### 🟡 MEDIUM PRIORITY — Taxonomy Consistency

#### Horizon Values in Use

Per `HORIZON_POLICY.md`, valid values are:
- `core` — Widely adopted (≥40% organizations)
- `emerging` — Fast-growing (<40% adoption)
- `perennial` — Evergreen foundational (stable ≥5 years)
- `watch_2030` — Future trend to monitor
- `peripheral` — Niche application
- `legacy` — Declining (<20% adoption)

#### Observations

1. **UPLS competencies** correctly use `perennial` for foundational skills
2. **Technical sectors** appropriately mix `core` and `emerging`
3. **No legacy KSAs identified** — may need review as technology evolves
4. **Limited use of `watch_2030`** — could add future-oriented KSAs

---

## Part 9: Cross-Reference Document Alignment

### Handbook ↔ Repository Alignment Check

| Document | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Sapience L&D Handbook UPLS list | ✅ Aligned | All 45 competencies present |
| B2C Intake Form dimensions | ⚠️ Needs mapping | No formal mapping schema exists |
| B2B Intake Form sectors | ⚠️ Partial | Technical sectors cover most industries |

## Appendix A: Validation Script Recommendations

Claude Code should run the following validation checks:

```bash
# 1. Check for UK spellings
grep -rn "behaviour\|organisation\|optimise\|summarise\|analyse\|utilise" content/

# 2. Check sector casing
grep -rn "sector:" content/Individual_KSAs/ | grep -v "sector: [a-z_]*$"

# 3. Find empty source_frameworks
grep -rn "source_frameworks: \[\]" content/

# 4. Find typos
grep -rn "researc[^h]\|contractinto\|strategy;integrates" content/

# 5. Find content reference artifacts
grep -rn ":contentReference" content/
```

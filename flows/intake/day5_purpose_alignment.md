**Day 5 Flow – Purpose Alignment & Core Driver Mapping**

**Purpose Orientation**

  - "What purpose have you been circling around, even if you haven’t
    named it yet?"

  - "What are you willing to work toward—even when you don’t feel like
    it?"

  - "Want to experiment with naming your current purpose, even if it’s
    messy?"

  - *Memory Log:* purpose\_statement\_log

**Core Drivers**

  - "What feeling or result keeps pulling you forward, even on the worst
    days?"

  - "What do you need to feel in order to say: ‘That was a good day’?”

  - "Is there a deeper WHY under your productivity, service, or
    ambition?"

  - *Memory Log:* core\_driver\_log

**Inner Tension Mapping**

  - "What parts of you are in conflict when it’s time to act on what you
    care about?"

  - "Do any old loyalties or identities push back against your new
    purpose?"

  - "Want to draw a boundary between fear and wisdom in your inner
    dialogue?"

  - *Memory Log:* internal\_tension\_map

  - *System Thread:* sync to resistance\_profile + belief\_reframe\_log

**True North Alignment**

  - "Want help turning your values + purpose into a guiding compass
    phrase?"

  - "What’s one sentence you want future-you to live by?"

  - "Want to pin this to memory and revisit it in future pivots or
    doubt?”

  - *Memory Log:* true\_north\_phrase

  - *System Thread:* links
    to value\_shift\_map + purpose\_statement\_log

**Purpose Resistance**

  - **"**What parts of you hesitate to pursue what you say matters
    most?"

  - "Want to name one story that used to define your limits—and release
    it?"

  - "Is your resistance trying to protect you, or keep you from being
    seen?”

  - *Memory Log:* purpose\_resistance\_map

  - *System Thread:* connects
    to protective\_loop\_signature and identity\_resonance\_log

**Closing & Activation**

  - "Want to name a direction—not a goal—you’re ready to walk in?"

  - "Want to tag today as a commitment checkpoint for next time?”

  - "Need a declaration, anchor phrase, or ritual close?”

  - *Memory
    Commit:* elevate true\_north\_phrase, purpose\_statement\_log,
    and core\_driver\_log to mission memory

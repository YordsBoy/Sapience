  Designing intuitive, accessible user interactions—gestural, voice, eye‑tracking—in immersive environments, applying ergonomics, affordances, and spatial‑UX heuristics to minimise discomfort and maximise engagement.
source_frameworks:
  - "XRA XR Interaction Design Guidelines"
  - "Apple visionOS Human Interface Guidelines"
proficiency_levels:
  - level: Awareness
    indicator: Recognises common XR gestures; explains comfort vs. presence trade‑offs; uses default interaction prefabs.
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Aligns UI elements within 30–60 cm comfort zone; ensures legible text sizes; designs ray‑casting selection; applies safe‑zone guidelines; conducts basic VR sickness checks.
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Implements hand‑tracking and haptic feedback; runs hallway‑usability tests; iterates based on System Usability Scale (SUS) and task-time studies.
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Designs multi‑modal interactions (voice + gesture); applies Fitts’s Law in 3D; integrates accessibility features for low‑vision users.
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Defines design systems for enterprise XR suites; mentors cross-func teams on spatial design literacy; leads enterprise UX standards for XR; publishes research on spatial‑interaction metrics; consults on ISO/IEC XR usability standards.

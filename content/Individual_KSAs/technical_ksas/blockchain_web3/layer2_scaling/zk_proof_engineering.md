  - level: Awareness
    indicator: Explains basic ZKP concepts (soundness, succinctness).
  - level: Basic
    indicator: Generates proofs with Circom/snarkJS examples.
  - level: Intermediate
    indicator: Writes custom circuits; benchmarks proving times.
  - level: Advanced
    indicator: Optimises recursion, aggregation; audits constraint systems.
  - level: Expert
    indicator: Designs novel ZK protocols; contributes to open-source proving systems.
